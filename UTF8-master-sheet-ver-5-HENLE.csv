simple,HN1035,Sonata in c minor for Viola and Piano,1,"Mendelssohn’s viola sonata is one of his many early works which remained unpublished in his lifetime. The autograph is dated ""d. 14 Febr. 1824"". Thus Mendelssohn was 15 years old when he completed the sonata. It assuredly numbers amongst his most mature early chamber music works. The key already indicates the seriousness with which the composer set to work. The first movement is preceded by a short adagio introduction. The middle movement, a menuetto, retains the key of c minor and not even the trio with its chorale-like melody lightens the minor mood. The closing movement is an andante with eight variations. It is a welcome addition to the scant classical-romantic viola repertoire.",43,"Mendelssohn Bartholdy\, Felix","Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Viola",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,,1,Instrument,Viola,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mendelssohn Bartholdy\, Felix",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1035.jpg

It is thus one of Faure’s late works, characterised by austerity, introspection and the intensity of its expression. It is hard to imagine a greater contrast to the brilliant and ornamental style of the virtuosic 1st Violin Sonata (HN 980), published 40 years earlier. The 2nd Sonata concentrates on the essentials, and on closer contact turns out to be a fascinating composition that harmonically explores the limits of tonality, delving deep into the “Modernism” of the 1920s.",62.5,"Faure\, Gabriel","Gabriel Faure, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Gabriel Faure,,1,Instrument,Violin,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Faure\, Gabriel",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1036.jpg

We do not know whether, when writing the composition two years later, the Habanera (French Havanaise) with its typical two beat dance rhythms was an allusion to the Cuban origin of his violinist friend.

Papillon was probably already composed in 1884, though it was only published in 1898. Whereas Faure just wanted to call it “Piece for violoncello”, his publisher insisted on a more evocative title, and ultimately succeeded in giving it its present name (meaning “butterfly”). But Faure is said to have been indignant, remarking: “Butterfly or dung fly – use whatever you want”.

The news that his brother Eduard was dying had deeply shaken him. “Writing a ‘Corpse Fantasy’ since Monday,” he wrote in his diary on 31 March. While he was preparing the composition for publication three-quarters of a year later, he chose the title “Night Pieces” with reference to E. T. A. Hoffmann. However, Schumann probably did not want the work to be perceived as being so nocturnal and dark, because he associated with it the desire that it should “pleasantly remind” one of his brother, who had in the meantime died.

Mozart refers to them in letters that he sent to his father from his trip to Paris (1777–79). In these letters he often refers to them as the “difficult sonatas” – probably alluding to the special interpretative demands. He thus provided these works with rich dynamic and articulative markings, advising a reserved tempo for their performance. The Sonata K. 280, which has a special place amongst the early sonatas due to ist melancholy middle movement in f minor, is now also available as a practical and reasonable single edition, which has been taken from our edition of the complete Mozart sonatas.",15,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1040.jpg

It was only in January 1788 that Mozart composed the two pieces K. 533, and had Hoffmeister in Vienna publish the three movements as a sonata. To this end he did, however, thoroughly rework the Rondo, incorporating a small fugue-like passage - perhaps to bring the finale closer to the other two movements. In its final version the work shows how intensively Mozart had looked into the style of Bach and Handel at the time.

Although he sometimes described the three Intermezzi as being “Wiegenlieder” (lullabies), he formally rejected this title: “It should then say, lullaby of an unhappy mother or of a disconsolate bachelor.” The new edition of these moderately difficult Intermezzi (level of difficulty 5/6) has now been revised following the musical text of the Brahms Complete Edition, and has fingerings by Andreas Boyde.",21,"Brahms\, Johannes","Johannes Brahms, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Johannes Brahms,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Brahms\, Johannes",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1042.jpg

We know that Dvo?ák had already sketched some of the material for these pieces in New York, and there are also indications that the composer initially considered writing a series of Scottish dances. In other words, these are thoroughly international pieces, with an inflexion all of their own.

Together with the Quartet in A-flat major op. 105, it forms a glorious close to his chamber music oeuvre. Echoes of Bohemian folk music are here mixed with cantabile themes, while his motivic working shows him to be a master at the height of his powers.

Most people are probably not familiar with the original version of this spirited miniature about the Spanish city and its native flamenco.

In fact, in around 1850, Wagner’s operas Der fliegende Holländer, Tannhäuser and Lohengrin – which would later be so successful – were only being performed at the Weimar Court Theatre under Liszt’s baton. Liszt was inspired to compose his Tannhäuser Paraphrase by performances in Weimar of the overture in 1848 and of the whole opera in February 1849.

His three miniatures for piano ""Gymnopédies"" are the first testimony to his idea of a ""New Simplicity"": repetitive, steady rhythms that are reminiscent of ancient cult dances have their very own meditative charm. Satie’s principle of stringing together musical units rather than forcing them to develop later proved groundbreaking for many musical movements of the twentieth century.

Perhaps inspired by the World Exhibition in Paris in 1889, Satie made use of oriental ornamentation. With his subtle intuition for musical tendencies that were ""en vogue"", he combined exotic elements with influences from cabaret music and, of course, his own ideas to create something very new. Several of the ""Gnossiennes"" take one by surprise on account of puzzling fragments of text between the lines of music.

The cycle’s title is derived from the name of the Spanish painter Francisco de Goya, whose paintings inspired Granados. The Goyescas conjure up Goya’s Spain of the late 18th century – chivalrous and sensual, but also melancholic and sombre. The overall theme is the life of two young lovers. The “Quejas” are a turning point in the cycle, because here jealousy leads to a lament that is joined by the song of the nightingale.

The spacious arpeggios, with fifths, fourths and seconds hovering above them in subtle rhythms, paint a maritime tableau that is in a genre all of its own: on the one hand we have a stylised picture of a boat at the mercy of the wind and the waves, while on the other hand an allegory of the volatile nature of human life.

The piano sonatas “with a violin accompaniment” K. 6–9 were composed in Paris. It is wonderfully fresh and varied music. The piano is joined by a violin that adds colour, but not as an equal partner unlike in the later, great violin sonatas (see HN 77–80).

Shortly before this, Dvo?ák and Simrock had travelled to Karlsbad with the proofs, where the Viennese music critic Eduard Hanslick was taking the waters.

These are no dreamy scenes of the night, but carefully structured, iridescent pieces that alternate between lyrical elegance and passionate drama. Faure composed the 6th Nocturne in 1894, while spending the summer at the house of his parents-in-law. With its strong contrasts of tempo, metre and harmony, it is by far the most significant and best-known of his Nocturnes. In a letter that he wrote after completing it, Faure wrote: “Modern piano music that is a little interesting is an extremely rare thing” – a state of affairs that seems to have been a good enough incentive for him to enrich the repertoire with his Nocturne op. 63!",22,"Faure\, Gabriel","Gabriel Faure, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Gabriel Faure,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Faure\, Gabriel",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1081.jpg

The publisher Simrock was so impressed by it that he accepted Brahms’s suggestion that he should publish a score of it alongside the individual parts – something that was by no means usual at the time.

The critics were initially rather sceptical towards this Sextet op. 36, but Brahms’s friends thoroughly approved of it.

Beethoven had already composed a little piano trio (B flat major WoO 39) for her in 1812. And now she was receiving a very different kind of work – the first of the heavyweight last three piano sonatas.

Our edition, made with the artistic collaboration of the Armida Quartet, draws upon the large body of modern knowledge concerning Mozart philology and performance practice. We begin with what are, chronologically speaking, the final four quartets: the so-called “Hoffmeister” Quartet, K. 499, and the three “Prussian” Quartets K. 575, 589 and 590.

And it is for this reason that Beethoven’s Sonata op. 90 is extremely popular today, both with piano students and also with professional pianists. It provides enough challenges: for example the notorious tenth figures in the left hand and – in the words of a contemporary – “uniqueness, striking twists and turns and an unfamiliar, yet no less stringent, composition”.

The Trio op. 114 is melancholy and autumnal in character, and is loved by all clarinettists. It is now available from Henle in a revised edition.

Clara Schumann, who played the solo part in the première of opus 92 on 14 February 1850 in the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, enthusiastically noted in her diary, “I am very looking forward to playing it – it is very passionate and I am sure I will play it thus”.",43,"Schumann\, Robert","Robert Schumann, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Robert Schumann,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schumann\, Robert",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1141.jpg
simple,HN1142,Piano Quintet in f minor,1,"This work, composed in 1878/79, alternates between chamber music intimacy and symphonic opulence, and marks the beginning of a series of significant late works by César Franck. Its composition was partly prompted by the successful performance of Franck’s youthful piano trios at the “Société nationale de musique” (founded in 1871), and probably also by a composition competition for works using this instrumental combination whose deadline Franck then went on to miss. The Quintet was received coolly at its first performance in January 1880, and it was performed just a few more times during the composer’s lifetime. It was only in the 20th century that audiences and critics came to recognise this work as a major milestone in the history of French chamber music, and it now adorns the Henle catalogue in a new Urtext edition.",103.5,"Franck\, Cesar ","Cesar Franck, Piano Quintet, Chamber",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Cesar Franck,,1,Instrument,"Piano Quintet, Chamber",1,1,Format,Score and Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Franck\, Cesar ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1142.jpg

Incidentally, the “bluebirds” do not refer to birds but to the light blue robes worn by the choristers at the monastery in Brno, which Janá?ek entered at the age of eleven. Almost 60 years later during a visit to Potsdam he remembered the Prussian troops’ invasion of Brno and, with this in mind, wrote a chamber music miniature with a military element.

Firstly, it was composed quickly in Luxor and Cairo in early 1896; and secondly, the composer incorporated elements of Egyptian and oriental music within it. He even wrote later that “The second movement is a kind of journey to the Orient, which in the episode in F-sharp even reaches the Far East. The passage in G is a Nubian love song that I heard sung by boatmen on the Nile”.
(Französisches Original:
«La seconde partie est une façon de voyage en Orient qui va même, dans l’épisode en fa dièse, jusqu’en Extrême-Orient. Le passage en sol est un chant d’amour nubien que j’ai entendu chanter par les bateliers sur le Nil.»)

The melancholy “Adagio after Hebrew melodies” was written in 1880 for the cellist Robert Hausmann. It treats two old Jewish songs whose extraordinary beauty proved deeply moving to the Protestant Bruch, by his own admission. The tenor cello sound is the ideal medium for the voice of a Jewish cantor, and thus to this day “Kol Nidrei” offers every cellist a wonderful opportunity to make the instrument “sing”. In this text, based on the first edition of 1881, “Kol Nidrei” appears for the first time in an Urtext edition substantiated by scholarly research, for which not just the musical sources, but also numerous letters and documents from the Max Bruch Archive were consulted.

Both pieces were written in 1828 and each one upon a musician’s request – in this case that of the horn player Rudolf Lewy. Schubert gave the first performance of Auf dem Strom with the latter and the tenor Ludwig Tietze on 26 March 1828 in Vienna. It was such a success that it was soon performed again, and the press raved about it being an “indescribable treat for the ears”.

It comprises two editions, gathered together in an attractive slipcase: the piano score and violin part without annotations (also available as HN 326), and the “Kremer part”. The latter includes fingerings and bowings by Gidon Kremer. The musical text is followed by an essay by Kremer about recordings of the Beethoven Concerto, bearing the attractive title: “Searching for Ludwig”. And this is not all: the first-movement cadenza by the composer Victor Kissine, which Kremer has already played numerous times, is published here for the very first time. The solo violin is here accompanied by wind and percussion. The edition also includes the corresponding performance materials for the cadenza, including the score and a piano reduction for study purposes.

It has since been proven that it was originally the final movement of the Piano Concerto no. 2 op. 19, which Beethoven replaced in 1794/95 with the movement we know today. The fact that it closely resembled Mozart’s style might have contributed to this decision. At any rate Beethoven kept the manuscript of the rondo all his life, showing its importance for him.

The little March K. 248 was presumably used to accompany the arrival and departure of the musicians on that occasion – it shares the same date of composition as the Divertimento, is in the same key, and is scored for the same instruments. Mozart later returned several times to this “First Lodron night music”, and posterity appreciated it too: the Divertimento was published just a few years after his death, and was also available in numerous 19th century copies. The only authorised sources for our Urtext edition, however, were the two autographs. Here, incidentally, the lowest part is designated “Basso”, which leaves open the question as to whether it was to be played by a cello, a double bass or both – a typical case of “as you like it” in the music of the 18th century!",74,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Chamber, Wind",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,"Chamber, Wind",1,1,Format,Set of Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1150.jpg

One such was the “Valse romantique”, published by Choudens of Paris in 1891 and thus written at the same time as his famous piano works Two Arabesques and the Suite bergamasque. This charming waltz is of moderate difficulty and thus ideal either as a pedagogical piece or for concert performance.

In spite of the pieces’ early date, the romantic, expressive harmonies of the two brief Aequale already reveal the “true” Bruckner, and look forwards to the chorale-like trombone passages in his later symphonies. Together with Beethoven’s Three Equali for four trombones WoO 30 (HN 1151) they are among the classics of the trombone repertoire.

simple,HN1179,Concertino op. 45 for Horn and Orchestra,1,"The horn is surely the most “romantic” of instruments, and it is a well-known fact that it plays a prominent role in Weber’s oeuvre. Der Freischütz and Oberon would be unthinkable without their horn calls, whether to signify yearning or the clarion call of the hunt. But Weber did more than give the instrument important solo parts in his operas; he also wrote a virtuoso concert piece that to this day is regarded as one of the most difficult in the whole horn repertoire – not least because the soloist has to play three-part chords (!) in the cadenza. This Henle Urtext edition is based on the autograph, the engraver’s copy (checked by Weber himself) and the first edition, and so offers the best possible musical text for those wishing to learn this highly effective virtuoso piece. The Preface also for the first time provides biographical details of Sebastian Rauch, the Munich horn player who commissioned this Concertino.",34.5,"Weber\, Carl Maria von","Carl Maria von Weber, Horn ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Carl Maria von Weber,,1,Instrument,Horn,1,1,Format,Piano Reduction paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Weber\, Carl Maria von",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1179.jpg

The specialist Karsten Nottelmann has edited Urtext editions of all of Franz Xaver’s piano works for Henle publishers (HN 958, 959), and now he is continuing with the Rondo for Flute and Piano.

As was usual with his piano works from 1912 onwards, each of the three highly distinctive pieces with their sound sensitive piano settings contained a short whimsical story printed in the musical text as a subtext, which is more or less closely connected with the music. Satie dedicated his “Next-to-last thoughts” to prominent contemporaries: Claude Debussy (for no. 1 “Idylle”), with whom he was close friends, Paul Dukas (no. 2 “Aubade”, in English “Dawn serenade”), whose music he greatly admired, and Albert Roussel (no. 3 “Méditation”), his former teacher of counterpoint at the Schola Cantorum in Paris.",15,"Satie\, Erik","Erik Satie, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Erik Satie,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Satie\, Erik",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1181.jpg

The third movement, marked “Largo drammatico”, is sustained by an insistent, heavily rhythmic dotted motive, while the final movement shifts from the introduction, marked “Pensierosamente, ma mantenendo strettamente il ritmo puntato”, into a brilliant finale, “Molto allegro e sarcastico”, that is suffused with elements of fugato and, like all movements, informed by dodecaphonic harmonies.

They lie so well under the hand for those who are a little used to Schumann’s and Chopin’s technique that it is a pleasure to practise them.” As the volume “Piano Pieces” was published in 2011 as part of the Johannes Brahms Complete Edition (HN 6014), we are now replacing the previous volume HN 118 with this new one, presenting these “magnificent pieces” in the musical text of the Complete Edition, accompanied by revealing commentaries detailing their genesis and publication.",28,"Brahms\, Johannes","Johannes Brahms, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Johannes Brahms,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Brahms\, Johannes",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1184.jpg

While concentrating completely on studying technical phenomena, he created valuable compositions that recall Paganini’s pieces of the same name. To this day, the “Caprices” are a milestone in every violinist’s education (conservatory level). For the first time, G. Henle Publishers’ Urtext edition clarifies in detail the matter of the source situation (first edition and revised edition) and offers the musical text in the “definitive version” with all historical notations.

So it is hardly surprising that it has seen many arrangements. Johannes Brahms marvelled at how a single staff of music could offer “a whole world of the deepest thoughts and the mightiest emotions”. He promptly made his own arrangement; it is for left hand alone, in order to come close to the restrictive framework of the original. He wrote enthusiastically: “A similar degree of difficulty, the manner of technique, the arpeggios – everything comes together to make me feel like a violinist!” This Henle Urtext edition by Valerie Woodring-Goertzen is based on the text of the new Brahms Complete Edition.

Their teacher-pupil relationship soon blossomed into love and they became engaged in 1888. It was in this year that Elgar composed “Salut d’amour” for his bride, initially with the German title “Liebesgruß”. They got married in 1889 and the work was published at the same time.

These three sonatas – all of them small masterpieces – are arranged in ascending order of difficulty and virtuosity. The four-movement Sonata in f minor is often called the “Little Appassionata” because it shares with the famous Sonata op. 57 not just its key, but also its impassioned mood – especially in the last movement. Murray Perahia’s fingerings have been tried and tested over several decades of performing these works, and offer a new approach to these milestones of the piano repertoire.

With its elegant head movement and the simple and moving Adagio, it is probably the most “Mozartian” of all of his three concertos, although the final rondo is reminiscent of Carl Maria von Weber.

The Swedish composer was himself a prominent clarinet virtuoso and the concertos were tailor-made for himself so to speak. Despite being technically very demanding, the Concerto in B flat major avoids being overly virtuosic and wins us over with its melodic ingenuity. It is a very welcome addition to our early Romantic repertoire for the clarinet.

These three sonatas – all of them small masterpieces – are arranged in ascending order of difficulty and virtuosity.

He prepared himself for this by taking an intensive course in composition, during which he wrote this brief “Lullaby” for string quartet as an exercise, probably in 1919. He liked its catchy melody so much that he later used it again in his one-act “jazz opera” Blue Monday Blues. “I find the piece charming and kind”, wrote his brother Ira in 1968 when the quartet movement appeared in print for the first time.

The beautiful natural surroundings led him to write this unconventional string quartet in the tradition of Beethoven’s “Pastoral” – even down to the imitation of birdcalls.

He was probably inspired by hearing Mozart’s Gran Partita shortly beforehand in Vienna. The home key of d minor here is striking, as is the often serious, even tragic atmosphere that repeatedly darkens the otherwise cheerful mood that is typical of the serenade genre. Perhaps this was a reaction to the death of two of his children just a few months earlier. Despite the work’s dramatic character – or perhaps because of it – Dvo?ák’s Serenade was taken up in many European cities soon after its first performance in Prague, and fêted as a significant contribution to the chamber music repertoire for wind instruments.

Today, this work is in the repertoire of all the great violinists.

Chopin’s Etudes are character pieces that are full of tension, written for the concert hall. The virtuosic works, including long-running hits such as the “Revolutionary Etude” op. 10 no. 12 belong to the pianist’s core repertoire. In addition to the two cycles op. 10 and op. 25, our Urtext edition also contains three Etudes without opus number, which Chopin composed for a Parisian piano method in 1840: wonderfully lyrical miniatures, which can hold their own with the 24 grand studies.",53,"Chopin\, Frédéric","Frederic Chopin, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Frederic Chopin,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Chopin\, Frédéric",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0124.jpg

He composed numerous fantasies on successful operas of the time, but pride of place undoubtedly belongs to his Carmen Fantasy. For this arrangement, composed in 1881, Sarasate deliberately chose those numbers that most clearly convey the Spanish atmosphere of the opera. Besides a version for violin and piano, Sarasate also wrote one with orchestral accompaniment. Both have since then delighted audiences and critics alike.

Following the first performance of the work in Prague by the pianist Št?pán Václav in December 1922, the composer and interpreter jointly undertook a revision, which was published in 1924.

And the oboist and soldier with the American occupation John de Lancie had indeed asked Richard Strauss in May 1945 whether he had ever thought of writing an oboe concerto. Strauss answered in the negative, but soon got to work anyway. In October 1945, he had completed the score in Swiss exile; the premiere took place in Zurich in 1946. Not until 1948 did the first edition appear in London, presumably for the most part without the composer’s involvement, for both the printed score and the orchestral parts exhibit numerous errors. Some of these have been known for a while, though others have only now been discovered by Hansjörg Schellenberger through his exact reconciliation of the autograph full score with the autograph particella.

This highly emotional work was also his first large-scale piece of chamber music. Its first public performance in December 1855 was regrettably not a great success, and so Smetana embarked on a protracted process of reworking it. By the late 1850s, it had reached its current form. Smetana always liked to perform it, but only found a publisher for it in 1880, when one of his pupils invited the Hamburg publisher Hugo Pohle to a performance at short notice.

In a letter to the convalescent Clara Schumann, Brahms spoke in a typically understated fashion about the two pieces “with which you can really run riot and test whether the course of treatment has actually had any effect”. We prefer to agree with Brahms’ friend Elisabeth von Herzogenberg: “the fact that the g minor is my favourite does not make me insensitive towards the intensely prickly beauty of the one in b minor”.

However, the elector replied that he was already familiar with parts of the Parthia op. 103 that had been sent as evidence of the composer’s progress. Beethoven had apparently only reworked an earlier composition. Nevertheless we must agree with Haydn: The Parthia and the Rondo WoO 25 that was originally intended as the final movement provide wonderful evidence of Beethoven’s great skill.

It was not until after Strauss’ death that the concerto appeared in print in London, making a critical new edition on the basis of the autograph sources and performance material more than overdue. The editor, Hans Pizka, former principal horn of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, learned first-hand about the performance tradition and genesis of the concerto as a pupil of Gottfried von Freiberg.

Henle Publishers is able to offer one of Rachmaninov’s most important, most substantial piano works in a meticulous Urtext edition that does justice to the work and to the editorial difficulties it raises. Rachmaninov was unhappy with the dense textures and the length of his Piano Sonata in b-flat minor, so almost 20 years after its composition and publication he made numerous cuts and “streamlined” it – though this has been criticised by pianists down to the present day. For this reason, it is mostly the first version that is played today – or even a mixture of the two versions such as Vladimir Horowitz used to perform (albeit with the permission of the composer). This Henle Urtext edition also takes into account the autograph in the Moscow Glinka Museum. As in all the Rachmaninov editions in the catalogue of G.

It owes its popularity not only to the brilliant violin part but also to the unusual form of the three movements that merge into one another without interruption.

The former is known for its dreamy, exquisite ambient sound – and yet it still numbers amongst Chopin’s most fabricated works.

The serenade was not premiered in its Bavarian homeland as might have been expected, but rather in Dresden, in 1882, under the direction of the then much-esteemed conductor Franz Wüllner, who had also given the inaugural performances of Richard Wagner’s Rheingold and Die Walküre and later premiered Strauss’ tone poems Till Eulenspiegel and Don Quixote. So it was a great honour for the young Bavarian!

Schumann could not banish the protagonist in the Maqama, Abu Said, whom he likened to the German character Till Eulenspiegel from his thoughts whilst he was writing the works. This explains the “foreign character“ of the pieces.

One of the best-known pieces amongst them is the Étude-Tableau in e flat minor with its dark towering chords and a weaving elegiac melody, such as only Rachmaninoff could write – so it is hardly surprising that none other than Vladimir Horowitz regularly performed the work in his concerts and recorded it several times.",13,"Rachmaninoff\, Sergei","Sergei Rachmaninoff, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Sergei Rachmaninoff,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Rachmaninoff\, Sergei",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1264.jpg

Henle Publishers’ complete edition of piano variations are compositions from his middle and later Vienna years written between 1799 and 1823. Among them are groundbreaking works such as the two sets of variations on original themes opp. 34 and 35, the Variations in C minor WoO 80, and, as the final crown jewel, the Diabelli Variations op. 120.

simple,HN127,Toccatas BWV 910-916,1,"Bach most likely composed his Toccatas in his early creative years, between 1707 and 1713; they can be seen as the products of Bach‘s own “Sturm und Drang” period, and were not planned as an interconnected work cycle, but as autonomous works written at different times. As was customary for this genre, the toccatas emphasize virtuoso and improvisatory elements, and, occasionally, the recitative aspect as well. What is indispensable is Bach’s mastery of the polyphonic technique, the rich harmonies, and the inexhaustible wealth of his inventiveness.",86.5,"Bach\, Johann Sebastian","Johann Sebastian Bach, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Johann Sebastian Bach,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,clothbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Bach\, Johann Sebastian",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0127.jpg
simple,HN1271,Sonata in G major,1,"Inspired by Béla Bartók’s violin sonatas, Ravel planned his own sonata for violin and piano in 1922, but at first did not get beyond sketches. Many interruptions ensued and the work was only finished in 1927. He dedicated it to his violinist friend Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Regarding the sonata’s sparse, thinned out compositional structure and instrumentation, Ravel later emphasized that the sonata proved the tonal incompatibility of the violin and piano. Yet it still succeeded in winning a permanent place in violin repertoire – not least because of its middle movement inspired by jazz elements and the “blues”. The fingerings in this Henle Urtext edition have been provided by two masters of their instruments: Christian Tetzlaff and Pascal Rogé.",48.5,"Ravel\, Maurice","Maurice Ravel, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Maurice Ravel,,1,Instrument,Violin,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Ravel\, Maurice",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1271.jpg
simple,HN1272,String Quartet no. 2 op. 15,1,"Alexander Zemlinsky’s music was long unjustly overshadowed by what was regarded as the “more progressive” Second Viennese School. Although Zemlinsky was close friends with its protagonist Arnold Schönberg, he never did take the latter’s radical step into dodecaphony. At the same time, he composed works that were no less original or fully fledged. Composed between 1913 and 1915, his Second String Quartet in particular pushed the contemporaneous understanding of form and tonality to its limits. With just one movement but spanning over 1,200 measures, this multi-faceted work numbers among the most significant contributions to the genre of the time and has long merited a critical new edition. 
The Urtext edition by G. Henle Publishers corrects many errors and inaccuracies in the first edition that came to light after careful comparison with the autograph sources in Vienna and Washington. For the first time, too, the metronome markings that survive only in one of Zemlinsky’s letters have been incorporated.

simple,HN1273,Valse-Scherzo op. 34,1,"Alongside the famous violin concerto, numerous other violin works by Tchaikovsky have found their way into the standard repertoire for violin. An outstanding example is the Valse-Scherzo, which sparkles with witty playfulness. He composed it in 1877 for the violinist Josef Kotek, a close friend and student. Our editor, the Russian Tchaikovsky scholar Alexander Komarov, has ensured that this Henle Urtext edition is absolutely faithful to the sources. He was able to consult all of the sources in the Russian archives and to bring clarity to the work’s complex genesis. This edition is the prelude to an edition of all of Tchaikovsky’s works for violin and piano, including the Sérénade mélancolique op. 26 and Souvenir d’un lieu cher op. 42.",34.5,"Tchaikovsky\, Peter Ilyich ","Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky,,1,Instrument,Violin,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Tchaikovsky\, Peter Ilyich ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1273.jpg

This was Tchaikovsky’s first concertante work for violin, the beginning of a path that was to lead to his Violin Concerto three years later. He composed the Sérénade mélancolique in 1875 for violinist Leopold Auer, originally for violin and orchestra, but later also in a version for violin and piano. Since the autograph sources are lost, this Henle edition is based on the Russian first editions, which even in Tchaikovsky’s lifetime were issued in a number of revised versions. The editor, Russian Tchaikovsky scholar Alexander Komarov, brings exemplary clarity to the confused state of the sources, while Ingolf Turban unlocks the notation of the violin part with his accomplished fingerings and bowings.",28,"Tchaikovsky\, Peter Ilyich ","Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky,,1,Instrument,Violin,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Tchaikovsky\, Peter Ilyich ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1274.jpg
simple,HN1275,Souvenir d’un lieu cher op. 42 for Violin and Piano,1,"“Memory of a dear place” is the title given to this collection of three enchanting pieces for violin and piano. The “place” in question was the country estate of Brailov that belonged to Tchaikovsky’s patron and friend Nadezhda von Meck. He stayed there in idyllic seclusion in May 1878 and completed this work. These pieces were composed very close in time to his Violin Concerto, and they too demonstrate Tchaikovsky’s matchless gifts as a Romantic master of melody. For this edition, the Russian Tchaikovsky specialist Alexander Komarov offers the highest degree of editorial precision, having drawn on all the relevant sources from both Russian and international archives. In the course of his work he has also been able to disprove beyond a doubt the view held up to now that the title Souvenir d’un lieu cher was only added after Tchaikovsky’s death.",32.5,"Tchaikovsky\, Peter Ilyich ","Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky,,1,Instrument,Violin,1,1,Format,Score and Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Tchaikovsky\, Peter Ilyich ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1275.jpg
simple,HN1276,Diabelli Variations op. 120,1,"Beethoven’s “33 Variations on a waltz by A. Diabelli”, composed between 1819 and 1823, are his most significant contribution to the genre. The notice announcing the publication of the first edition aptly claimed that “These are no variations of the usual kind but a great and important masterpiece”. The Viennese publisher Anton Diabelli had asked 50 composers to write one variation each on his waltz, for publication in an anthology. But instead, Beethoven used it for a comprehensive exploration of the genre’s traditions.
This Urtext edition, revised on the basis of the Critical Report of the Beethoven Complete Edition, is a stand-alone edition taken from the volume Variations for Piano II (HN 1269).

simple,HN1277,Piano Trio in g minor op. 3,1,"Following his early elimination from the “Prix de Rome”, the sought-after award for composition students at the Paris Conservatoire, Chausson withdrew to the country in summer 1881 and began composing this ambitious work – out of defiance, so to speak. During his lifetime the trio remained an insider’s tip amongst those close to his teacher César Franck. It was only after its posthumous publication that it was performed more frequently and was gradually recognized as being one of the best chamber music works of his time. Closely based on Franck’s principle of the cyclic interleaving of all motives, it still has dark and melancholy inflections all of its own. The Henle Urtext edition is the first critical edition and a welcome addition to our collection of French music.",71.5,"Chausson\, Ernest","Ernest Chausson, Trio, Chamber",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Ernest Chausson,,1,Instrument,"Trio, Chamber",1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Chausson\, Ernest",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1277.jpg
simple,HN1278,Dolly op. 56 for Piano Four-hands,1,"The six pieces in this little suite were written between 1893 and 1896. They were inspired by Hélène Bardac, the daughter of a singer with whom he was friends. The girl was born in 1892 and called “Dolly” on account of her small, delicate figure. The pieces, composed mainly for her birthday or the New Year, reflect the world as experienced by the growing child, from a lullaby to a temperamental dance. But it was not meant to be taken too seriously, as shown by the subtle allusions to his own music and that of others. Despite their simple basic structure these pieces, which soon became popular, contain numerous harmonic and rhythmic subtleties typical of the French composer – “children’s music” that is also well suited to adults.",36,"Faure\, Gabriel","Gabriel Faure, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Gabriel Faure,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Faure\, Gabriel",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1278.jpg

Rachmaninoff greatly valued this work, often included it in his concert programmes and also recorded it. A longing melody unfolds over a simple accompaniment. This charming piece that alternates between major and minor is a good technical exercise for the crossing over of the hands, but does not contain nearly as many difficulties as Rachmaninoff’s other etudes and is thus also manageable by advanced amateurs. They will be aided in the Henle Urtext edition by the helpful fingerings provided by the virtuoso Marc-André Hamelin.",13,"Rachmaninoff\, Sergei","Sergei Rachmaninoff, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Sergei Rachmaninoff,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Rachmaninoff\, Sergei",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1279.jpg

But it was only in March 1905, in the mild climate of Algeria, that Saint-Saëns finally relented and composed a large sonata with four movements. He personally thought it superior to the first sonata and even believed that its third movement, the “Romanza”, was an equivalent to the famous “Swan” in the “Carnival of the Animals” (HN 943). However, this work is still overshadowed by the first sonata, not least because the second places greater technical and artistic demands on cellists. Our Henle Urtext edition, the first text-critical edition of the work ever, now offers cellists a chance to rediscover this composition.",69,"Saint-Saens\, Camille ","Camile Saint-Saens, Cello",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Camile Saint-Saens,,1,Instrument,Cello,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Saint-Saens\, Camille ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1280.jpg

The publisher can freely admit this, because the odd notes here all come from Mozart himself – he consciously inserted them into his Musical Joke. In this amusing and mischievous piece, Mozart does not chiefly parody musicians who play wrong notes (the later title “Village Musicians” was not his). Rather, in this chamber music joke he aims an angry side-swipe at dilettante composer-colleagues of his time, whose lack of imagination and artless compositional technique are here mercilessly demonstrated.

In this case, the French horn player Henri Chaussier provided the impulse. He had developed a novel “Cor omnitonique” and wanted to demonstrate the merits of his instrument with Saint-Saëns’ composition. Chaussier’s invention did not gain acceptance amongst horn players – although the ""Morceau de Concert"" did! From today’s standpoint the popular work with one movement is not overly demanding technically; in addition, Saint-Saëns himself suggested two abridgements to simplify the piece, meaning that even advanced pupils can venture to play it.",32.5,"Saint-Saens\, Camille ","Camile Saint-Saens, Horn",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Camile Saint-Saens,,1,Instrument,Horn,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Saint-Saens\, Camille ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1284.jpg

His shorter solo pieces impress on account of their enchanting melodies and their attention to detail, which is also true of the Rêverie for horn and piano. Glazunov was himself a good horn player and played in several orchestras as a young student. It was at this time that Glazunov composed this highly romantic work in which he showed off the melodious qualities of this instrument to their best advantage. It is an effective recital piece, even for advanced pupils, and is being published for the first time as an Urtext edition; alongside the first edition we also consulted Glazunov’s autograph in the National Library of Russia in St Petersburg for the first time.",18.5,"Glazunov\, Alexander","Alexander Glazunov, Horn",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Alexander Glazunov,,1,Instrument,Horn,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Glazunov\, Alexander",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1285.jpg

His publisher must have had an inkling of the success of this collection, as shortly after its publication in its original version for piano four hands in 1866, he asked the composer for a version for piano solo.

After initially hesitating, Brahms suggested two versions, one for “clever hands and one – perhaps for the more beautiful ones”. Both versions were published in 1867. The simplified one, which Brahms also called the “version for children”, not only thins out some of the full chords but also transposes complicated keys. Thus no. 6 is no longer in C sharp major but in the easier key of C major instead. G.

With this passionate and highly virtuosic Sonata, Brahms introduced himself to the great of the musical world of his day, including the Schumanns in Düsseldorf. Clara Schumann wrote afterwards that “... the whole is full of exuberant fantasy, intimacy of expression and mastery of form”.

This work has a special place in his oeuvre. Besides its passionate atmosphere, his contemporaries discerned it to be “serious and dignified in character”.

These are the parts that form the basis for the compilation that we find in this volume.
The Italian Concerto and the French Overture constitute Part II and, in a way, serve as a kind of echo of French and Italian orchestral music of the time, here transposed to the keyboard.

There are indications that the young Brahms was inspired by Robert Schumann’s Sonata op. 14 – which was also in f minor. The music critic Eduard Hanslick also believed that he could discern the influence of Brahms’s older colleague when he wrote about the Sonata op. 5: “The whole of Brahms is here, though still under the spell of Schumann”.

Only when he went to spend the summer in Annecy-le-Vieux in Savoy did Faure succeed in writing the Andantino, the unusually extensive, elegiac middle movement of this Trio. The outer movements then followed in Paris the next winter. This late work by Faure is notable for its clear lines and forms and for its balance between the piano and the string instruments.

Our single edition (taken from the volume of all of Reger’s sonatas and pieces HN 909, also edited by Michael Kube) meets this wish today: its effervescent Tarantella and the Albumblatt that is full of nuances provide clarinettists and pianists with an easy introduction to Max Reger’s magical world of sound.",17.5,"Reger\, Max","Max Reger, Clarinet",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Max Reger,,1,Instrument,Clarinet,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Reger\, Max",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1296.jpg

In the outer movements, its piano setting and modulations break the intimate mould of chamber music, alluding to the sensational first symphonic poems written at the same time. Between the first and last movements, both of which are also technically very demanding, the slow middle movement, “Improvisation”, offers a respite. A kind of song without words, it was also published as a single movement and enjoyed great popularity in the years around 1900 in household and salon concerts.

Not without pride did the composer stress to his publisher that both works were “arranged in a truly quite new fashion.” For the first time ever, the Eroica Variations are available in a standalone edition.

These are the parts that form the basis for the compilation that we find in this volume.
The Italian Concerto and the French Overture constitute Part II and, in a way, serve as a kind of echo of French and Italian orchestral music of the time, here transposed to the keyboard.

The title of the present work – translated as “Capriccio on the departure of his most beloved brother” – reveals that this is programmatic, onomatopoeic music of the kind that was very popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. In its six short and imaginatively-titled movements Bach shows a different side of himself from the usual polyphonist.

Beethoven’s sole contribution is perfectly suited to its genre designation in that the work, written in 1809, provides “a faithful portrayal of the way he used to improvise” (to use the words of Beethoven’s student Carl Czerny). Meandering through keys and tempos, the piece presents a variety of different musical ideas that only relatively late in the piece flow into a self-contained Allegretto in B major and reveal its real goal to be a set of variations.

In fact, it is an “occasional” piece in the best sense of the word, having been written in winter 1814/15 for the Russian Czar Alexander I’s wife, a great admirer of Beethoven’s music. The Czarina was sojourning in the Austrian capital at the time of the Congress of Vienna.

To this day it stands – unjustly -- in the shadow of its more popular neighbours, the brooding, impassioned f-minor Sonata op. 2 no.1 and the mighty, virtuosic one in C major op. 2 no. 3. In its expressive serenity, its formal structure replete with surprising turns, and its sheer joy in music-making, it is the one in the set that most closely reflects the influence of Haydn’s teaching. At the same time, however, it manifests some idiosyncratic traits that point far into the future, such as in the Largo appassionato, the passionate mood and introspection of the melody that dominates the second movement, and in the first designation of the following Menuet as “Scherzo”, coupled with a real Ländler as Trio.",23,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van","Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Ludwig van Beethoven,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1308.jpg

With its distinctive musical humour the middle sonata has a particular connection with the opus 2.This humour comes particularly from unusual formal experiments with motivic-thematic elements that led a contemporary reviewer to reproach the master for being “a man of genius” on the one hand, but also for allowing himself too often the right to “wildly pile up his ideas”.",16.5,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van","Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Ludwig van Beethoven,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1309.jpg

While the typical rhythm and noble character of the Polonaise repeatedly shine through the notes, the Polonaise-Fantaisie is characterized above all by a great freedom in its thematic and formal aspects.

But the fragmentary work that later came into the hands of Johannes Brahms from Schubert’s estate, delighted its new owner so much after its premiere in 1867 that Brahms had the first movement published three years later as Schubert’s “Posthumous Work” – thus paving the way into audiences’ hearts for this little gem. Schubert’s autograph manuscript features such numerous divergences in dynamics and articulation that editor Egon Voss suspects it to be one of Schubert’s experiments with variations. This is why in his Urtext edition he proceeds with extreme restraint in issuing additions and changes with respect to parallel passages ¬– thus making Schubert’s diversity of ideas comprehensible for performing musicians.

What is surprising, however, is that the piece, still so popular today, is untitled in the source materials, and was not published until after the composer’s death.

A particularly eloquent example is the “Grande Valse brillante” op. 18 which, with its multiplicity of charming melodic ideas and moods – now gently rocking, now overwhelming, now again triumphantly jubilant – became one of Chopin’s most popular waltzes.

However, its first edition -- from the Viennese publisher Artaria in 1798 -- was dedicated to Magdalena von Kurzböck, who was among the leading female pianists of her time and numbered among the highest-ranking musicians of that royal and imperial capital city. Haydn knew both women, and even was a witness at the wedding of Therese Jansen and Gaetano Bartolozzi in May 1795. The term “Grand Sonata” – as it was called in its early prints – honours not only the scale and technical demands of the work, but also its tone. The impressive and imposing start to the opening movement makes it absolutely clear that this supremely effective work was conceived for the concert stage. The ethereal Adagio (with its harmonic shift to E major!) constitutes a meditative rest point before a Hungarian-inspired Presto Finale brings the piece to a rousing close.

Like its companion work the Sonata in E-flat major Hob.XVI:52, the C major sonata was written in London in 1794/95 .

With an opening movement characterized by two contrasting themes, a sensitive Adagio in f minor and a sparkling Presto Finale, no. 3 of the collection, in F-major, is an outstanding example of the classical sonata.

Their relatively high opus number is misleading, however, for both these two-movement works were composed at roughly the same time as the piano sonatas op. 10, between 1796 and 1798. The fact that they were actually published seven years later is presumably thanks to the business dealings of Beethoven’s brother Carl, who initially offered them to several publishers without success. Finally, in 1805, a Viennese publisher relented and accepted them – not yet aware of the treasures that had fallen into his lap. These little masterpieces, cast in an easily manageable format, soon became highly popular.

The work is reminiscent of the appealing piano waltzes that the composer used to write when he was younger – although there is a certain distance to the usual waltz style. Liszt by no means renounces virtuosity and elegance, but rather infuses these characteristics with nostalgia and irony by embedding typical melodic and rhythmic elements of salon waltzes in innovative, harmonically alienating progressions. In the years that followed he wrote three further “Valses oubliées”, yet number 1, published here in a single edition, has remained the best-loved of these “Forgotten waltzes” by far.",13,"Liszt\, Franz","Franz Liszt, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Liszt,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Liszt\, Franz",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1329.jpg

According to legend, the work was composed at the end of 1830 in Vienna, when Chopin had just left his homeland for good. The November uprising had broken out in Warsaw, and the composer alternated between wanting to revolt against fate and feeling inconsolably homesick.

His String Quartet in f minor op. 9, which he completed that same year, was supposed to mark the beginning of a new style that was less orientated towards Wagner. However, much to his disappointment, it was rejected by musicians. Notwithstanding this painful experience Dvo?ák gave the slow movement of the quartet a second chance, reworking it as a Romance for Violin and Orchestra or piano.

Ysaÿe was so inspired by the Sonata that he promised “I will play this masterpiece wherever I can find an artistically-minded pianist”. Nothing has changed to the present day regarding the work’s continuing popularity, but it was time to revise Henle’s previous edition to reflect the latest research. In the intervening period it has been shown that Franck was actively involved in reading the proofs for the printed edition, meaning that the first edition, which contains many differences from the autograph, has become the basis for our new one.

There is no trace of the influence of Indian or African-American music in this, his final chamber work; rather, the piece is striking for the amount of cantabile themes and motives, and their contrasting and artistic treatment. It seems that his relief at seeing his children and family again directly influenced the work. Dvo?ák himself wrote in a letter during its composition that “Almighty God has granted us this cheerful moment, and thus we all feel unutterably happy”.

Saint-Saëns also wrote several such pieces for violin, cello, and horn. His only Romance for flute was composed in 1871, shortly after the Société nationale de musique had been founded. It was premiered in this new forum for piano music and chamber works a year later, too. In spite of its brevity, the piece contains numerous harmonic and melodic refinements, which rapidly made it popular among flautists – both in the original setting with piano accompaniment as well as in the later orchestral version. The Henle Urtext edition is the first critical edition of this piece, which is also very popular with learners of the flute.",22,"Saint-Saens\, Camille ","Camile Saint-Saens, Flute",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Camile Saint-Saens,,1,Instrument,Flute,1,1,Format,Score and Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Saint-Saens\, Camille ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1354.jpg
simple,HN1355,Piano Concerto no. 2 in g minor op. 22,1,"Given Saint-Saëns’ talents both as pianist and composer, it stood to reason that he would engage with the piano concerto genre early on. But he gave a clear renunciation of the “concerto brilliant” that was dominant in France at that time, declaring instead that “the solo part of a concerto must be set out, and treated, like a dramatic role”. He realised this concept of a “symphonic concerto” in this second piano concerto, composed in 1868. The solo part is technically very challenging, and at the same time closely bound up with the orchestra. Johannes Umbreit is responsible for the piano reduction, based on the composer’s own version for two pianos; Pascal Rogé supplies the fingerings for the solo part.",55.5,"Saint-Saens\, Camille ","Camile Saint-Saens, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Camile Saint-Saens,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,Piano Reduction paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Saint-Saens\, Camille ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1355.jpg
simple,HN1356,Love Song (Dedication) from Myrthen op. 25,1,"In his virtuosic piano arrangement of Schumann’s “Widmung” (“Du meine Seele, du mein Herz”), Franz Liszt transformed this intimate song into a dramatic declaration that reaches its powerful climax at the phrase “Mein guter Geist, mein bess’res Ich”, using chords to be played con somma passione. In Liszt’s autograph the melody is overlaid by the song text, but he changes the title to “Liebeslied”. The first edition, published in Leipzig in 1848, retained this heading, and thus the song is still known today under two different titles.

In their predisposition and attitude, both works are very closely related. In the cello sonata, a sombre, dramatic opening movement is also followed by a calm, relaxed slow middle movement and a graceful finale. The critical response to the first performances was subdued, but on account of increasing interest in Faure’s complete late chamber music, this sonata has recently been rediscovered as a substantial part of his oeuvre. The Henle Urtext edition constitutes the first critical edition of this work.

Friend and associate Vincent d’Indy wrote to Faure the day after the premiere in May 1922: “I would like to tell you how much I am still charmed by your so beautiful sonata. In it I found what is seemingly forgotten these days: music.” It therefore comes as no surprise that the sonata rapidly found its way into the concert repertoire, where it maintains an uncontested position to this today.

As to the original Violin Concerto, there are no extant cadenzas in Beethoven’s hand.

In this first large-scale two-movement sonata, Beethoven experiments with striking character contrasts in the first movement and a virtuosic perpetuum mobile duet in the second. In both interpretation and mastery of technical difficulties, this sonata therefore poses a considerable challenge for pianists and might have been avoided for this reason as well. The sonata shares the fate of many early works by Beethoven in one respect: no autograph exists. Murray Perahia and Norbert Gertsch have thus only been able to examine an original edition as a source for their new edition. As always with the new editions of Beethoven sonatas from Henle, Maestro Perahia also provides the fingerings – and his own commentary on the meaning of this sonata.",17.5,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van","Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Ludwig van Beethoven,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1366.jpg

In August he received reports of the approaching end of the First World War, and this good news so inspired him that he was able to finish an initial draft of his great Violin Sonata in barely four weeks. Writing about it in his diary, he notated laconically: “Wrote some music”. His wife Alice was more enthusiastic: “E. writing wonderful new music, different from anything else of his”. This magnificent music is now available in a Henle Urtext edition by the British violinist and Elgar expert Rupert Marshall-Luck. He has examined and evaluated the many sources according to all the rules of Urtext editing – the sketches, drafts, autograph fair copies, proofs and first edition.

He wrote several preludes and fugues and the chorale prelude “O Traurigkeit, o Herzeleid” in the mid-1850s, at a time when he was making an intensive study of counterpoint. The Eleven Chorale Preludes op. 122, on the other hand, are Brahms’s final work, composed in 1896, immediately before and after the death of Clara Schumann. This revised Henle Urtext edition presents all of Brahms’s organ works in a single volume, following the musical text of the New Brahms Complete Edition, and with a preface and a commentary that reflect the latest scholarship.

simple,HN1369,Hot-Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano,1,"Erwin Schulhoff (1894–1942) was one of the most original personalities on the music scene of the early 20th century. His persecution and ostracism by the National Socialists led to his being forgotten for a time, though in recent decades the extraordinary quality of his music has been rediscovered. It was inspired by jazz, Dada, atonal music and socialist realism. Schulhoff’s Hot-Sonata of 1930 displays the influence of jazz not least through the use of the saxophone as solo instrument, but also in its pithy rhythms, its glitzy harmonies and its use of playing techniques such as glissandi. The Hot-Sonata is published here for the first-ever time in an Urtext edition. It eliminates numerous mistakes found in the first edition that had been reprinted up to the present day. All the relevant sources were consulted for this edition: the autograph, an engraver’s copy, Schulhoff’s own copy of the published work, and further personal documents such as letters and contracts.

The war against the Turks was constraining the Viennese people’s interest in music – works were not commissioned and concerts did not take place. It was of no matter that Mozart had shortly before (in 1787) been appointed a salaried k.k. Kammer-Kompositeur. Nevertheless in this year he composed several of his most important works: the “Coronation Concerto” K. 537, the three late symphonies as well as several piano trios.

Highly virtuosic salon pieces with echoes of national folk music traditions from all over Europe are at the centre. Sarasate published his eight Spanish dances in four books between 1878 and 1882. They alternate between fiery passion and a yearning expressiveness, and are undoubtedly among his most successful compositions. In masterly fashion, Sarasate here mixes up Spanish folk tunes with arrangements of popular compositions of the time. As in the case of the Henle Urtext edition of Sarasate’s Zigeunerweisen (HN 573), a violin wizard of our own time is responsible for the fingerings and bowings: Ingolf Turban.",67,"Sarasate\, Pablo de","Pablo de Sarasate, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Pablo de Sarasate,,1,Instrument,Violin,1,1,Format,Score and Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Sarasate\, Pablo de",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1370.jpg

Playera and Zapateado op. 23, which make up nos. 5 and 6 of the third volume of Spanish Dances, were composed in the summer 1879. Zapateado is a breath-taking, highly virtuosic dance in which the violin is able to show off all its technical possibilities. This is why the work also quickly became one of the composer’s most successful performance pieces for himself as violinist.

The “Toccata”, an insanely virtuosic tour de force in a jazz-inspired idiom, has already occasionally been heard performed as an encore at his concerts.

For the first time, the Variations op. 34, are now available from Henle in a standalone edition.

The title of the present work – translated as “Capriccio on the departure of his most beloved brother” – reveals that this is programmatic, onomatopoeic music of the kind that was very popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. In its six short and imaginatively-titled movements Bach shows a different side of himself from the usual polyphonist. Perhaps we owe this piece to the departure of his brother Johann Jacob Bach, who entered service in Sweden in 1704.",17.5,"Bach\, Johann Sebastian","Johann Sebastian Bach, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Johann Sebastian Bach,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Bach\, Johann Sebastian",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1375.jpg

S. Bach’s works. Considerable evidence suggests that he viewed these three pieces as paradigmatic examples of his transcription technique. Busoni’s explicit labelling of the Prelude and Fugue “for concert performance” in the title already serves as an indication of the heightened virtuosic requirements. And, indeed, here Busoni demands that the pianist have perfectly mastered the keyboard, always with the aim of delegating to the piano, effectively but still in the spirit of Bach, the mighty sound-world of the organ work. This Urtext edition is heartily recommended to all those pianists who have ever wanted, finally, to pull out all the stops on the piano.",29,"Bach\, Johann Sebastian / Busoni\, Ferruccio","Johann Sebastian / Busoni Bach, Piano",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Johann Sebastian / Busoni Bach,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Bach\, Johann Sebastian / Busoni\, Ferruccio",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1376.jpg

He was already 28 years old when he obtained the contract for the composition of the Quartets opp. 18 from Prince Lobkowitz, and 30 when he completed them. These are mature works that clearly distinguish themselves in their technical demands from, say, those of Mozart’s quartets; yet on the other hand, they orient themselves musically on Mozartian practice. The A major Quartet K. 464 obviously served as a model for Op. 18 no. 5. Be that as it may, Beethoven’s six Quartets op. 18 are completely autonomous works that are on a par with many of the major contributions to this genre.
In the 1980s, scribal copies – in which Beethoven had presented the quartets to his patron Prince Lobkowitz – once again became accessible. They represent a stage prior to the final version, having richer dynamics and articulation marks that make them interesting from a performance practice point of view.

To this day, the violin duets are favorites for use in violin lessons, but also for making music at home. Though lesser known today, around 1800 Ignaz Pleyel numbered among the most popular composers in Western Europe - which may at first come as a surprise, but which to judge from these very appealing pieces, manageable for advanced beginners, is easily understandable.

The melodious Quintet op. 115 has been popular with musicians and audiences alike since its premiere in 1891.

This was the time when Beethoven was writing more or less one piano sonata after the other. In between, he enjoyed putting pen to paper and creating occasional single pieces.

As the tempo marking Moderato e grazioso already suggests, the Rondo in C major boasts a prevailingly charming character, which it essentially seeks to maintain in the c minor middle section.

Today we can even access performances of the dances by Bartók himself; these recordings document varied repeats enriched by octave doublings to make a sort of “concert version” of the dances.

Unlike in his other works for piano of these years, he did not use any folksong melodies or folkloristic elements here. Instead, he endeavoured to achieve a new, more “abstract”, transparent piano style that forgoes ornament and embellishment. A special feature of this Henle edition is the appendix with an additional Andante movement that was originally intended to come before the Scherzo, but which Bartók removed from the Suite only shortly before its publication in 1918. The Urtext edition of this important work in the concert repertoire follows the musical text of the Bartók Complete Edition.

Bartók initially withdrew this work from publication, however, and added new pieces to it using folk music he had collected in the meantime. The first edition was only finally published in 1920. The Bartók scholar László Somfai explains the work’s complicated genesis in his preface. The comments at the close of this edition include important indications regarding performance practice derived from the two recordings that the composer made of several of its pieces in 1927 and 1936.

The manner in which he confronts folk melodies with subtle, avant-garde sounds here was later described by Bartók himself as venturing to “the outermost limits”. He also breaks up the song structures so radically into their constituent motives that the title “improvisations” best conveys his approach to this folk music. The musical text of this Urtext edition, edited by Bartók expert László Somfai, is taken from the relevant volume of the Bartók Complete Edition.

simple,HN1406,Romanian Christmas Songs,1,"Bartók’s Romanian Christmas carols are based on folk melodies that originated in a pagan celebration of the winter solstice, and which he felt gave “the impression of a fiery, war-like type of song, rather than a pious and religious one”. Nevertheless, he chose 20 melodies from this collection of “colinde” and published them under the title of “Christmas carols”. In the first edition of 1918 they were conceived for children’s hands and so were published “without octaves”; but in his revised edition of 1936, which we present here, Bartók added an appendix featuring alternative “concert versions”, confirming that these miniatures are also perfectly suited for public performance. Our Urtext edition is based on that of the Bartók Complete Edition, and for the first time integrates these concert variants directly into the musical text. We also offer the original melodies and translations of the texts of these colinde to provide an insight into the origins of this rather different kind of Christmas music.

Originally outlined for the collection 15 Hungarian Peasant Songs (Urtext edition HN 1404), the drafts were left untouched for the next twenty years. Not until 1941, when Boosey & Hawkes asked the composer to contribute to an anniversary album for the great pianist Ignaz Paderewski, did Bartók, now settled in the United States, return to these long since notated piano pieces on the folk music of his homeland and thoroughly revise them. Unusually, the first edition issued in 1942 did not include the folk music sources; however, they have of course been reproduced in this Urtext edition based on the Bartók Complete Edition.

simple,HN1466,Methodical Sonatas for Flute or Violin and Continuo Volume II,1,"“Methodical” was how Telemann’s six sonatas were described when they were published in 1732, because they included a second, ornamented version of the simple melody line of the solo instrument for the slow opening movements and for the second movement of the c-minor sonata. This is music that is both instructive and also a delight to play, and G. Henle Publishers can highly recommend it to the flautists and violinists of today. This lavishly appointed new edition has separate solo and bass continuo parts that contain the other part in each case for orientation purposes. There is also an additional part featuring only the figured bass line. This edition includes the score, which also features a historically faithful realisation of the figured bass. The first volume of “Methodical Sonatas” has already been published (HN 1266); this means that all twelve of Telemann’s sonatas are now available as Henle Urtext editions.",86.5,"Telemann\, Georg Philipp","Georg Philipp Telemann, Flute, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Georg Philipp Telemann,,1,Instrument,"Flute, Violin",1,1,Format,Score and Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Telemann\, Georg Philipp",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1466.jpg
simple,HN1467,Piano Sonata in b minor op. 5,1,"During his youth, Richard Strauss composed a large number of works for piano solo, among them numerous sonatas. Yet it was only the Sonata in b-minor that he obviously considered important enough to want to see in print. It was composed in two versions, presumably between winter of 1880 and spring of 1881, and published one year later. Here, Strauss still plainly follows his compositional forebears from German Romanticism. The two middle movements of this demanding sonata in particular directly recall Mendelssohn’s “Songs Without Words” and scherzi.

According to the autograph manuscript, the composition was finished on June 27, 1883, and Strauss also prepared the piano reduction himself. The Romance is regarded as one of Strauss’ most mature youthful works, though it was long overshadowed by the cello sonata, despite several quite successful performances given by the then-famous principal cellist of the Munich Court Orchestra, Hanuš Wihan. Only since the posthumous first edition of 1986 has the music world been rediscovering this striking work, which now also appears in a Henle Urtext edition.",28,"Strauss\, Richard","Richard Strauss, Cello",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Richard Strauss,,1,Instrument,Cello,1,1,Format,Piano Reduction paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Strauss\, Richard",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-1468.jpg
simple,HN147,"Piano Sonatas, Volume I",1,"Schubert’s 22 piano sonatas sketch a very illuminating picture of the prematurely departed composer’s compositional path. From the first essays of the gifted young 16- to 19-year old, one can trace a continuous development leading to the five great sonatas which he wrote in the years 1823 and 1826, and finally to the three masterworks written shortly before his death, which place him on a level with Beethoven as a composer of sonatas.

Volume I of the three-volume Henle Urtext edition of Franz Schubert’s piano sonatas contains seven sonatas from the two earlier periods as well, which all became known with opus numbers. Only two were published during Schubert’s lifetime. The book opens with what is no doubt the best-known sonata of these two periods, the A-major Sonata D 664 op. post. 120.

That he wasn’t eclipsed by the latter was ensured by the extremely scintillating piano part, with which Beethoven the pianist was able to present himself in the best light. Opening with a slow introduction, the Allegro of the F-major sonata dazzles with its abundance of melodies.

The artful coupling of the two instruments is on display from the outset in an almost programmatic manner, when the cello with its tenor timbre first intones a melody that the piano then continues. In this sonata, too, Beethoven dispenses with a slow movement while nevertheless compensating us with an enchanting Adagio cantabile introduction to the finale.

One reviewer of the original edition noted in 1818 that they “doubtless number among the most unusual and peculiar things written in a long while.” Proceeding from the established Classical schema, here Beethoven explores possibilities for changing and expanding sonata form, which make Opus 102 the capstone of his cello œuvre. In the Sonata in C-major, unusual elements emerge in the very structure: two fast movements, each preceded by short introductions at a slow tempo – an idiosyncratic, unique formal construction.

The Sonata in D-major reflects Beethoven’s preoccupation with traditional counterpoint; if in the opening movement his ingenious combination of extremely different themes elicits admiration, then in the “Allegro fugato” section of the finale we witness how he conjures from one simple theme the highest contrapuntal art.

Beethoven had it published as a standalone movement, presumably in 1805. The movement, marked “Grazioso con moto,” is characterised by a large variety of compositional techniques ranging from simple chord progressions to orchestral-like octave runs. Because of its particular popularity, this single movement was published as “Andante favori” in its second printing – a moniker that apparently harks back to Beethoven himself.

Schumann himself called the opus a “romantic spectacle”, and it met with a decidedly warm response from the critics: “Flashes of humor appear at every turn; skyrockets of wit and unbridled merriment soar upwards into the skies from all sides.” The first public performance had to wait until 1860, after Schumann’s death, when his widow Clara presented Faschingsschwank to a Viennese audience.

simple,HN200,"Piano Trios, Volume III",1,"In the Classical period, and well into the 19th century, piano trios were something of a musical fashion accessory. There was thus good reason for Beethoven also to engage with the genre, following the example set by Haydn and Mozart. He left 13 piano trios in all.

The works contained in Volume III almost all present a few peculiarities: opus 44 is also not a complete trio, for instance, but consists of only one single variation movement! WoO 37, written while Beethoven was still in Bonn, is striking for its scoring (piano, flute and bassoon). He wrote WoO39 for Maximiliane, youngest daughter of the Brentano family, “to encourage her piano playing”. Op. 38 is an arrangement of the Septet op. 20 for piano, clarinet and violoncello, and the last piece has come down to us only in one sketchbook from Beethoven’s Bonn period. None of these works has the weight of Beethoven’s major piano trios; nevertheless, they remain witnesses to his supeme artistry.

XVIII: 10, transmitted only in one single manuscript, was not rediscovered until the 1960s and first published by the Henle Urtext edition in 1969. In the sole surviving manuscript, the solo instrument is identified as a harpsichord, but various criteria unequivocally suggest that it was intended for the organ.

The fact that Schumann was very preoccupied with counterpoint at the time cannot be missed.

Later he allowed an incomplete work consisting of two middle movements to appear as op. 103, adding to the print the portentous words: “Gone is all my strength, old and weak am I.” Musically, however, these quartets are anything but weak: they represent the aged composer virtually at the zenith of his powers.

Clockmakers often invited celebrated composers to write pieces for such a clock. This led to the composition of little works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Haydn, Mozart and many others. Mozart’s three works for the Flötenuhr K. 594, 608 and the Andante K. 616 are nothing less than pearls of this literature, which also includes the arrangement for piano presented here.",20,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0232.jpg

The latter continued to develop the light, song-like piano writing and created works whose dreamy, longing atmosphere came to embody Chopin’s music.

Yet even if they exhale Mozart’s spirit, they are already and unmistakably typical Beethoven. Further evidence of his regard for the pieces can be found in his re-use of the third quartet’s slow movement in his first Piano Sonata op. 2 no. 1.

The most important among them are without a doubt the six Organ Sonatas op. 65, which have become an indispensable component of the general organ repertoire. The spark was possibly lit by two English publishers who – thrilled by Mendelssohn’s organ playing – ordered various organ pieces in different formats from the composer.

These pieces were written in 1844/45 and then collated to form six organ sonatas. However, they did not constitute sonatas in the strict sense of the word, but rather suites. In their multiplicity of forms – reminiscent of chorales and lieder, of polyphonic and virtuoso pieces – they form a genuine compendium of organ playing.",72.5,"Mendelssohn Bartholdy\, Felix","Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Organ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,,1,Instrument,Organ,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mendelssohn Bartholdy\, Felix",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0237.jpg

The compositional interweaving of the sonatas for flute and harpsichord reaches its apogee in the contemplative b minor sonata, which is a masterpiece of the flute repertoire.

This applies first and foremost to Mendelssohn, who has always been called a “classical romantic.” His Quartet in a minor op. 13 in particular is said to have strong Beethovenian stylistic traits. It was composed in late summer and fall 1827, shortly after Beethoven’s late quartets appeared in print, works that Mendelssohn was no doubt familiar with.

In keeping with the source, however, the work also features allusions to Baroque models – embellishments, pedal points – and ends in a grandly laid-out fugue with a triumphant build-up.

Though generally designated as a year of crisis, an entire series of Schubert’s important works were created precisely at this time, when the Wandererfantasie, for example, but also the Symphony in B minor, the “Unfinished,” began to cast their spells on music lovers all over the world. There were several precursors, in particular the fantasias of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Mozart. Nevertheless, Schubert continued to develop the genre in this masterpiece. He combined the principle of the fantasia with that of the sonata cycle, by dividing the whole into four large sections (movements) that flow seamlessly into one another, whereby he derived the thematic material from a core which – not surprisingly – consisted of measures borrowed from the song Der Wanderer in the second movement. This work was one of the few instrumental works of Schubert’s to have appeared in print during his lifetime, and was already receiving encomiums from the critics back in its day.

One interesting feature of the collection Hob. XV:15-17 is that, thanks to their scoring for flute instead of violin, they differ from Haydn’s other trios. They were commissioned by the London publisher John Bland, who had paid a visit to Haydn in 1789. Haydn immediately put pen to paper and created three extraordinarily charming pieces full of imaginative touches and elegance, which were published in summer 1790. The use of the flute is undoubtedly due to the instrument’s unique popularity in the circles of the English middle classes and aristocracy; nevertheless, a performance with violin is also perfectly feasible and even explicitly suggested in the F-major Trio Hob.

It was not until 1874/75 that he brought the final version to paper, replacing two movements of the original version with new ones.

He increased the intensity of his writing into genuine virtuosity in the b minor Rondo D 895 composed in late 1826. The critics of Schubert’s day were already praising “the bold master of harmony” and “the fiery fantasy” of the piece.

Thus this Italian pianist and composer helped fashion the entire Classical era in music. However, his pedagogical tour de force, the “Gradus ad parnassum”, has tended to negatively influence the esteem he enjoyed as an artist, something that our first volume of Clementi’s piano sonatas should help to rectify. This selection of ten moderately difficult to difficult works allows a glimpse into Clementi’s sonata workshop between 1768 and 1785. His predilection for the finer points of part-writing and contrapuntal art blend here with a formal and dignified classicism. Our carefully revised Urtext edition is based on the first versions of the pieces, published in the 1770s and 1780s.",64.5,"Clementi\, Muzio","Muzio Clementi, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Muzio Clementi,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Clementi\, Muzio",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0317.jpg

The highly individual form is a puzzle to all who prefer more traditional genre concepts. Is it a sonata movement, a rondo, or even a free combination of character movements such as march, recitative or chorale? Chopin lovers have no need of such considerations, seeing that nobody would ever dare to doubt that this Fantasie is one of the greatest works from his pen. After completing the composition, Chopin wrote “The sky is bright, but my heart is afflicted by sorrow”. This gloomy contrast pervades the Fantasie.

simple,HN3215,Piano Concerto g minor op. 33,1,"Written in one fell swoop and polished for ages: thus arose one of the most significant works of Czech piano music. Dvorák’s G-minor Piano Concerto was composed in barely two months in 1876 only to be refined for more than seven years before it finally appeared in print. As a result, Dvorák’s handwritten score abounds in changes and corrections. The 141-page autograph bears impressive witness to the work’s extraordinarily difficult gestation. Besides the original text, it contains annotations in lead, red and blue pencil as well as red ink, not to mention many passages hidden beneath pasted slips of paper. Until 1990 the score was owned by Dvorák’s heirs. At the instigation of the pianist András Schiff – and with his generous financial support – we can now present the first complete facsimile edition of this exhilarating document in a high-quality reproduction that uncannily resembles the original to the last jot. Readers are invited to track down and follow the stages in the work’s genesis.

Its four leaves contain a fair copy of the work; two leaves with a sketch-like character follow. Haydn composed the work, at the time still entitled “Sonate”, for “Signora de Ployer” (probably the pianist Barbara Ployer associated with Mozart). The variation movement was apparently intended as the beginning of a sonata with several movements. As can be seen from the second part of the autograph score, Haydn later extended the movement and ended it with an expansive Capriccio Coda. The first print already bears the title “Variations”.

Amongst these works, the paraphrase on Giuseppe Verdi’s “Rigoletto”, which was published in 1860, occupies a special place on account of its incredible virtuosity and at the same time its filigree texture. On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of Liszt’s birth, G.

The op. 11 was given the nickname “Gassenhauer Trio” because its third movement is a set of variations on a theme from Joseph Weigl’s opera L’amor marinaro (“Gassenhauer” means a “popular song”). Playing with many possibilities in these nine variations, Beethoven sometimes lets the piano appear alone, and sometimes has it rest. In places the mood is that of a sort of funeral march, and there are harmonic and rhythmic surprises throughout.
The op. 38 “Grand Trio”, the later of the two, was a reworking by Beethoven himself of his op. 20 Septet. He provided – as also in the case of op. 11 – an alternative violin part, in order to give the work broader distribution and thus greater popularity.

He wrote it in October 1784, though what might have triggered this incredible outpouring of a “romantic” world of feeling is unknown. Half a year later, Mozart composed his C minor fantasy K. 475, an extraordinary work in every regard. Both of these C minor works were published together in one edition in 1785, meaning that they were intentionally linked together by their author, counter to convention.
Until 1990 the autograph manuscripts of the Fantasy and Sonata in C minor were lost, and G. Henle Verlag were the first to undertake a thorough revision of the texts immediately following their re-emergence in Philadelphia, USA, at that time. In many instances, corrections had to be made to the musical text as previously known, because the most important sources up to that point – the first edition, as well as an authorized dedication copy of the sonata – proved to be imprecise and erroneous.

The work in no way reflects this, quite the contrary. “Full of strength and freshness” said Clara Schumann of the new composition, as well as “extremely brilliant and effective”. Even Richard Wagner added his voice to the great wave of admiration. Thus op. 44 soon became one of Schumann’s most successful compositions, which today is still a jewel in chamber music literature. If the quartet reminds one of a piano concerto with orchestra in string quartet format at times, this is explained by the fact that it was intended for Clara’s repertoire. The work was also dedicated to this brilliant pianist.?",87.5,"Schumann\, Robert","Robert Schumann, Piano Quintet, Chamber",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Robert Schumann,,1,Instrument,"Piano Quintet, Chamber",1,1,Format,Score and Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schumann\, Robert",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0355.jpg

They, along with the six cello suites, are regarded as musical and technical milestones of musical literature. Bach skillfully employs the resources of the violin to produce genuine polyphony in some sections through the use of arpeggiated chords and double stops. The culmination of these achievements is the famous Chaconne from the second Partita, which achieves great musical density while presenting the violinist with previously unheard-of technical challenges.

However, it is very unlikely that they were actually written by Beethoven, and for this reason they do not have opus numbers but instead are listed in his catalogue of works as “Anhang/Appendix 5”.

It was not long until the Funeral March – which was written two years before the sonata’s other movements of the sonata – was removed from this context and performed as an independent piece.

Thus the “Six Studies in Canonic Form” op. 56 and “Four Sketches” op. 58 for pedal piano, which are reminiscent of Bach’s Inventions, were composed during a relatively short period starting in 1845. From a music history perspective, the “Six Fugues on the name BACH” op. 60 for organ or pedal piano are the first important organ compositions on the B-A-C-H theme before those by Franz Liszt and Max Reger. With his compositions for pedal piano – the Leipzig School of Music had one at that time – Schumann wanted to “bring new impetus to piano music”. However, this type of piano, which was equipped with a pedal keyboard, did not find wide dissemination in the years that followed. Therefore it is more than legitimate to play the compositions by Schumann presented in this edition on the organ.

Handel used the theme with five variations as the closing movement of his fifth keyboard suite, which he published in 1720.

However, with the melody of the Old German Minnelied “Verstohlen geht der Mond auf” used for the slow movement of the first sonata, and the lines from a poem by Sternau that preface the second movement of the Sonata op. 5, Brahms also proclaims his allegiance to Romanticism. The push-and-pull between Classicism and Romanticism then becomes clearly audible in the opp. 1, 2, 4 and 5. – In contrast, the Ballades op. 10, written just barely a year after the Sonata op.5, are thorougly romantic piano pieces.

The suite was only published in 1905, although Debussy had made it clear by adding the date of composition “1890” to the proofs that it was an earlier work.

Johannes Brahms likewise did not hesitate to use a work by Paganini the violin virtuoso as the basis for a composition for his own instrument, the piano, using the Capriccio no. 24 in a minor from Paganini’s op. 1 as his model. Brahms initially viewed the Variations, composed in 1862/63, merely as a “finger exercise” for himself, and had no intention of publishing them. After several years he fortunately decided otherwise, and thus with this Urtext edition pianists who are Brahms aficionados can enjoy an unusual virtuoso masterpiece. In contrast to the variations on the same theme by Chopin, Schumann and Liszt, those by Brahms offer a much richer, more novel spectrum of pianistic variations.

While this of course cannot be ruled out, not a single concrete piece of authentic evidence exists that points to such a connection. Use of a minor tonality as the compositional realization of a personal experience of pain is a sort of interpretation that also falls considerably too short; Mozart’s art is far too multifaceted for it to be pinned so one-dimensionally to his biography. The sole authoritative source for the Urtext edition of this much-loved and much-played sonata is Mozart’s autograph manuscript (which in parts is difficult to decipher), as the first edition published in 1781 (together with K. 309 and 311) is riddled with errors.",16.5,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0396.jpg

What a pyrotechnic display of wonderful and freely vibrant melodies in the first movement, artfully coupled with pianistic runs and flourishes! The sublime slow movement (“Andante cantabile”) could pass as the piano reduction of a string quartet, while the concluding “Allegretto grazioso” is like the jaunty but subtle dance finale from an opera buffa. As we know today, Mozart composed this miraculous sonata in 1783 – previous Mozart scholarship missed the mark entirely with its much earlier date.

Only in the spirited B-flat major finale (“Allegretto”, in alla breve meter) does the mood shift to – restrained – gaiety. Strangely enough, this sonata was initially published (posthumously in 1796) as a violin sonata, a version that is not at all hard on the ears. If we didn’t have Mozart’s autograph manuscript of the piano sonata (albeit only in fragments), along with his entry in his own catalogue of works (Vienna, February 1789: “A sonata for piano solo.”), one might presume that this sonata in B-flat major existed as a genuine pair of twins (with and without violin accompaniment).",16.5,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0398.jpg

Schubert’s role as successor to classical-era composers is clearly evident in them, while at the same time his very own, deeply personal tone resounds here. Our carefully revised edition of this frequently performed B flat major Sonata is based on the autograph and first edition. Once again, Schubert here seems to have gathered up all his powers of introspection and tranquillity. Above all, the calm theme of the first movement captivates through its dreamlike expression.

Dvorák dedicated the work to his children Otilie (aged 15) and Antonin (10), and it is in keeping with the abilities of the young pianist daughter and little violinist son. Nevertheless, Dvorák writes: “grown-up adults should also be able to take enjoyment in these pieces in the same way that they can”.

Weber here arranged the waltz frenzy of the dance-crazy Biedermeier era in a concertante form, letting one waltz follow the other, sometimes gently swaying, sometimes wildly stomping. The movements are framed by a poetic introduction and a finale. The work is presented here in an Urtext edition based on the autograph fair copy, but also takes into account the first edition and a copyist’s manuscript.

There has been frequent speculation about what type of scoring would be most appropriate for the piece, particularly since Bach wrote the individual parts in score form and left no information about instrumentation. Certainly, strict fugues can be found in any ensemble scoring; this had been normal for centuries. It is remarkable, though, how the cycle can easily be played on the harpsichord or piano – a strong argument for keyboard performance.

The Ballade is considered to be Grieg’s most important piece for piano and is most certainly his most personal composition, even though he himself never performed it in public.

But they are combined with the melodic and harmonic language of the 19th century, and with Grieg’s characteristic compositional style. In this way the music achieves the charming mix that is the reason for its popularity. Even though the string orchestra version is better known today, Grieg first wrote the work for piano.

His contribution to the piano music of the 19th century is significant in two respects: following Schubert and Schumann he cultivated the small, lyrical form, while as Beethoven’s successor he admitted large forms such as the piano sonata and variation cycle. His two variation cycles op. 21, published in 1862, place great demands on the performer. In the first cycle, on a lyrical theme in D major, the technique of figurative and contrapuntal alterations is highly developed. The “Variations on a Hungarian Song” should be a refreshing challenge for the advanced pianist, owing to their metrical features and their virtuoso temperament.

His “Vorschule der Ästhetik” with its extensive treatment of humour probably occasioned Schumann to think of giving a piano work the title “Humoreske” – thus giving birth to a new musical genre. The “romantic humour” is not, however, aimed at humour in a modern sense of the word, but rather at a portrayal of the fragility and contradictory nature of the human condition.

The violin concerto in G major Hob. Vll:4 was probably composed in the early 1760s, before his appointment by the prince. It thus comes as no surprise that it is very different from the other two concertos; the solo violin part hardly goes beyond the third position, and the focus is more on lyricism than virtuosity.
For (younger) violin learners the work thus offers a good opportunity to engage with Haydn the composer for the first time.

Beethoven did not give these occasional pieces an opus number, so today they are numbered only as WoO (Werke ohne Opus, or works without opus). A few dances are piano arrangements of orchestral dances, since piano reductions for home music-making were indispensable at that time.

The merging of the concertante cadenza form with that of the technical etude was one of Niccolo Paganini’s greatest creative achievements. With his op. 1 Capriccios Paganini opened up a new musical dimension in the genre. They seem improvised, overflow with melodic abundance and are of a clear, spirited design. This Urtext edition is based entirely on Paganini’s autograph, since the first edition contains numerous errors and was probably not proofread by the composer.

The present edition offers the five verifiably authentic works of the catalogue group Hob. XIV in its main section, and in the appendix the Divertimento Hob.

Thus in 1796 Franz Joseph Haydn composed his Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major Hob. Vlle:1, which numbers today among the major standard works of its genre, especially for Weidinger. Contemporaries described the tone of the Klappentrompete as soft and delicate, and perhaps this is why Haydn placed more value on lyrical themes than on brilliance in this concerto.

It is thus only logical that, as well as the violin and cello, he also thought of making use of the typical melodic character of the flute in this way.
Through the skillful use of broken chords he even succeeds in creating the illusion of polyphony.

It is interesting, however, that d1 is the lowest melodic note in the piece, which might mean that it is a flute arrangement of a violin sonata. The other two sonatas also stand on an uncertain footing in regard to their sources. On the other hand, their elegant slow movements are crafted with a melodic mastery such as is often found in Johann Sebastian Bach’s music.

Brilliant playing technique combines here with catchy melodies. The technically very demanding Sonata op. 24 in C major from 1812 brings together four different moods in its four movements.

The piece’s sunny mood – it sounds much more cheerful than Schubert’s other chamber music – comes across like an echo of the felicitous summer months of 1819. The then twenty-two-year-old Schubert passed these in convivial company at Steyr in Upper Austria, and subsequently set to work composing. The present Urtext edition largely follows the Viennese first edition, which likely reproduces the original version of the now lost autograph.

In 1844 Liszt had already begun work on the cycle that was only published in 1850. Although he had the pieces engraved, this version was never actually printed. He replaced no. 3, a precursor to the first Hungarian Rhapsody, with a piece in the style of a nocturne by Chopin (it can occasionally be heard as an encore at piano recitals), and he simplified the remaining numbers.

The Piano Sonatinas op. 89 are a marked exception to the Reger rule. Reger, whose writing for the piano was often virtuosic and dense, greatly retracted this here, favouring instead a wonderful airiness and transparency. Nevertheless, unlike a sonatina by Clementi for instance, these four Reger Sonatinas are not easy to play (according to our levels of difficulty, the easiest, the Sonatina in D major [No. 2], is considered 5/6 – that is medium level of difficulty.)",64.5,"Reger\, Max","Max Reger, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Max Reger,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Reger\, Max",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0469.jpg

But another important work can be found in this Henle edition too: the earnest C minor fugue for two pianos K. 426, reminiscent of Handel’s or Bach’s great art, here in its original form from 1783. Mozart published it soon after in a four-part version for string quartet, adding a beautiful, freshly composed Adagio introduction. This, in turn, has been rescored in our edition for two pianos by the brilliant musician Franz Beyer, who also has completed a performable version of Mozart’s two-piano “Larghetto and Allegro” in E-flat major (a work not included in Köchel’s catalogue) from the surviving fragments.

By making use of the Baroque master’s second printed collection of keyboard suites and single pieces of 1733, the interested pianist can paint a colourful picture. Among pieces entitled “Sonata”, “Suite”, “Prélude” or “Chaconne” within HWV 434–442 is to be found the well-known “Chaconne in G major” with its 21 variations, a work still performed in concert halls today.
The player will also discover here the Aria with five graceful and playful variations that were made famous through Johannes Brahms’ own variation set. Since the collection was published in London and Amsterdam without Handel’s consent, and in a print that included many mistakes, an Urtext edition is vital for creating a reliable text.

His works for violin solo are unique, and his appearances as virtuoso fascinated audiences from the very beginning. Yet, in addition to the violin, Paganini also learned to play the guitar as a child. And before travelling throughout the world he must have got to know the Genoese song “Barucaba” in his hometown of Genoa, writing his op. 14 Variations for violin and guitar upon this song in 1835.

In January 1824, before publication of all of the Müller songs that summer, the Theme and Variations in E minor for flute and piano were written, prefaced by a weighty introductory section. The work remains Schubert’s single and singular virtuoso composition for flautists: tremendously difficult for the flute to play, and, incidentally, sometimes very tricky for the piano to “accompany.” Schubert’s much-reworked autograph manuscript is the sole authoritative source for our Urtext, as it demonstrably served as the engraver’s copy for the posthumously published first edition.

Scarlatti triumphed over the heavy Baroque style with his characterful themes, natural cantabile melodies, and dance-like movements. The performance-technical moment is a formally constitutive element within his one-movement sonatas. For the first time in the history of piano music, the interpreter must cross the hands and master wide leaps. Renowned pianist Bengt Johnsson provides information on Scarlatti’s life and career, as well as on the various sources on which this edition is based, in his preface.

Anyone in search of romantic piano poetry off the beaten track may find much pleasure in this, Dvo?ák’s largest piano cycle from 1889, for example in the impressive piece “At the Old Castle” or in the lively “Peasant Ballad”. The autograph and the first edition from the year of the work’s composition have been used by editor and Dvo?ák specialist Milan Pospíšil as the basis of our Urtext edition.",64.5,"Dvorak\, Antonin ","Antonin Dvorak, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Antonin Dvorak,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Dvorak\, Antonin ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0492.jpg
simple,HN493,Variations and Fugue on a Theme by J. S. Bach op. 81,1,"The variation cycle and the fugue are genres in which Max Reger developed a special mastery. Thus one can speak of Reger’s unique Bach Variations op. 81 as the culmination of his piano oeuvre, offering everything that is typical and characteristic of Reger’s style. No other piano work by this great Bach admirer can measure up to this monumental composition in terms of sheer size and inner weight. Written in Munich in 1904, the Variations are considered challenging to play and difficult to comprehend; but aspiring pianists should not let themselves be deterred by this legend. Behind the complex notation are a clear structure and a wealth of expression. Technical complexity and aesthetics here correlate in an almost classical manner.",46,"Reger\, Max","Max Reger, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Max Reger,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Reger\, Max",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0493.jpg

simple,HN495,Sonata for Violoncello and Piano in g minor op. 65,1,"It is well known that Chopin almost exclusively wrote works for solo piano. Only for the cello did he make some exceptions: two works – a Polonaise brillante and the Duo Concertant (HN 788) were written for cello and piano, and he also let the cello express itself in his Piano Trio op. 8 (HN 1068). Finally, towards the end of his life, he honored the low-stringed instrument with a grand, four-movement Sonata in g minor. Proof that it was anything but child’s play is provided by the extensive sketch material. Chopin himself claimed: “With my cello sonata I am now satisfied and now dissatisfied. I toss it into the corner, then pick it up again.” Today we only have an inkling about this struggle. The sonata, with its famous melodic Largo movement, is now firmly embedded in the canon of cello literature.

simple,HN496,Syrinx for Flute solo,1,"Syrinx is undoubtedly among the works that are immediately associated with Debussy. The piece, which was given its first performance under the title La flûte de Pan, was composed in 1913 as incidental music to a dramatic poem by Gabriel Mourey. In the central scene Pan is playing a reed flute, which is actually the nymph Syrinx. Pan is, however, invisible to the other nymphs and to the audience. In order to reflect the staged situation, the dedicatee Louis Fleury used to play the piece behind a screen when he played it in concert. It was only published by Jobert in 1927, following Debussy’s death; its popularity has remained unsurpassed to this day.",14,"Debussy\, Claude","Claude Debussy, Flute",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Claude Debussy,,1,Instrument,Flute,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Debussy\, Claude",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0496.jpg

This cycle features various genres, including piano pieces typical of the epoch such as etudes, waltzes and mazurkas, but they are also joined by pieces presumably connected with Tchaikovsky’s biography. These bear titles like “Au village”, “Marche funèbre” and “Rêverie interrompe”.

Beethoven always aspired to treat the various genres in the most original way possible. Horn players can thus enjoy Beethoven’s Horn Sonata op. 17, which the composer wrote in 1800 for a concert in Vienna’s Hofburg Theatre for the most famous horn player of his day, Giovanni Punto (Johann Wenzel Stich). At that time, an alternative instrumentation was necessary for successful dissemination of the work, so this Urtext edition, like the first one, includes a violoncello part in addition to the one for horn.",37,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van","Ludwig van Beethoven, Horn ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Ludwig van Beethoven,,1,Instrument,Horn,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0498.jpg

In around 1800, these timbres inspired composers such as Beethoven and Hummel to compose for this unusual ensemble. During his sojourn in Prague in 1796, Beethoven wrote a number of such pieces for Countess Josephine von Clary-Aldringen, who played the mandolin. Sweetness and playful esprit present themselves here in many facets. Since Beethoven did not use any mandolin-specific turns of phrase, and since he wrote here for an instrument with g–d–a’–e”, tuning, these works are also readily playable on the violin.

Schumann’s empathy with the highly romantic inflections of Adelbert von Chamisso‘s poetry may also have arisen from the circumstances that prompted this cycle, for it was written during one of the happiest periods of his life, just before his marriage to Clara Wieck.

simple,HN551,Myrthen op. 25,1,"1840 was Schumann’s famous “year of song” that brought forth over 100 lieder. They included Myrthen op. 25, which he dedicated “to his dear bride”, Clara Wieck-Schumann. Besides famous songs such as “Widmung”, “Lotosblume” and “Nussbaum” to texts by German poets, the collection also saw Schumann venture further afield, whether to the Scottish Highlands with settings of Robert Burns or to Italy for the “Venetian Songs” of Thomas Moore. Schumann specialist Kazuko Ozawa has examined the first edition of 1840 and all the manuscript sources. Among the dedicatory autograph copies she has also discovered interesting early versions of individual songs that are here published in an appendix. Our Urtext edition is rounded off with an extensive history of how Myrthen was composed. This volume is a superlative addition to G. Henle Verlag’s series of Robert Schumann’s song cycles.

Yet it has a special place: it was composed in the time immediately following Schumann’s marriage to Clara Wieck. Schumann set a series of poems to music in November, during a “quiet week, which went by with composing and much loving and kissing”, and the cycle was complete by the turn of the year. It contains a great deal of intimate musical innuendos. The first edition of 1841 was soon followed by a second issue, many of the songs were published individually and the “Wanderlied” soon became a core piece in the repertoire.

And the Sonata for flute solo was published twice in the 1760s. The riddle is not to be solved.

The second sonata seems to be the earlier of the two. The composer also reprised the theme of the second movement, Tempo di Menuetto, for the Menuet in the Septet op. 20. It is one of his best-known piano pieces, which just about every budding pianist encounters early in his lessons.",16.5,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van","Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Ludwig van Beethoven,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0056.jpg
simple,HN560,Hungarian Dances nos. 1-10,1,"“No opus number” is what Brahms gave his astonished publisher to understand, when he offered him the Hungarian Dances for publication in 1869. He placed a great deal of importance on the fact that he had merely “set” popular Hungarian melodies and not composed new works as such. As true as this reservation is, it did not affect the success of these works. The Hungarian Dances are today without a doubt amongst Brahms’ best-known compositions. Brahms himself made an arrangement of the dances 1–10, originally for piano four hands, for solo piano. We are now publishing a revised version of these impressive pieces with the up-to-date text in the new Brahms Complete Edition.

simple,HN561,Concerto for Horn (Trumpet) and Strings in E flat major,1,"One of the best-loved trumpet concertos today is actually a horn concerto: Neruda composed it in about 1750 at the Dresden Court, where he met the greatest horn virtuosos of the day. As a result, the solo part is immensely demanding and is kept in the upper clarino register throughout (up to g'''), which means that only a few horn players today can master it, even on the modern valve horn. But on the trumpet, however, these difficulties do not apply. This new edition by G. Henle Publishers is based on the only extant manuscript source, which is held in Prague. It takes modern performance practice into account and thus also contains parts for trumpet in E flat and in B flat. As an Urtext edition – and in contrast to earlier editions – it forgoes the articulation and dynamic markings that have otherwise been added so freely, and thereby enables us to have an unbiased view of the original notation.",34.5,"Neruda\, Johann Baptist Georg","Johann Baptist Georg Neruda, Horn, Trumpet",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Johann Baptist Georg Neruda,,1,Instrument,"Horn, Trumpet",1,1,Format,Piano Reduction paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Neruda\, Johann Baptist Georg",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0561.jpg

However, Faure gave up the sonata project, instead publishing the piece under the title “Élégie”. It was so successful that Faure was urged by the publisher to write further pieces.

Its theme also served as the basis for a larger-scale set of variations for cello and piano. The importance that Rossini ascribed to this short piece for double bass is demonstrated not least by the fact that he made a richly ornamented dedication copy of it in 1858.

His unique violin technique enthralled the public right from the start. So it was no surprise that Sarasate composed highly virtuosic pieces for his own use.

Beethoven’s spirit is present in this composition too, even if it was not, perhaps, afforded an equally intensive degree of inspiration and artistic effort. The “Presto alla tedesca” became famous because the motif of a third, like the call of a cuckoo, is taken through all the keys. The middle movement is pervaded by unpretentious beauty in the form of a melancholic Russian melody, while the finale delights with its humoresque character. The work’s modest level of technical difficulty makes it a musically demanding practice and recital piece.

simple,HN6,Sonatinas  for Piano and Violin op. post. 137,1,"Every young violinist is familiar with Schubert’s sonatinas for violin and piano. The title “sonatinas” used here is derived from the posthumous print of 1836; Schubert himself called them “sonatas.” The diminutive form was no doubt selected because the pieces are fairly easy to play; marketing considerations perhaps also played a role here. With their typically lively, Schubertian melodies, they are among the most popular pieces ever written for piano and violin, and have continuously maintained their position as “bestsellers” in the Henle catalogue (having the “early” publisher’s number 6).
Schubert wrote them in 1816, thus at the age of 19. The first edition sometimes diverges considerably from the autograph; fortunately it has survived almost in its entirety (missing is the finale of the 2nd sonatina). For this final movement, the first edition had to be consulted as a source.",46,"Schubert\, Franz","Franz Schubert, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Schubert,,1,Instrument,Violin,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schubert\, Franz",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0006.jpg

Two minuets follow, inspired by the timbre of woodwinds; and a quick finale in 2/4 with a striking opening motive concludes this masterwork of medium difficulty.

And the sequence 1–6 of the piano sonatas K. 279–284, which were probably composed in Munich at the beginning of 1775, is based solely on Mozart’s retroactive numbering of them (with just the manuscript of the first movement of the first sonata having been lost). In the family correspondence these six sonatas are, incidentally, characterized many times as the “difficult sonatas.” That can scarcely be meant in a technical sense, but, as the editor of the Henle Urtext edition, Ernst Herttrich, surmises, might rather have alluded to their enormous “aesthetic, interpretive demands,” given that “Mozart furnished … the six sonatas with exceptionally rich dynamic and articulation markings … more than any of his previous works.”",16.5,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0600.jpg

The three sonatas were probably composed only shortly before printing, countering the assumption of earlier Mozart scholars. This first edition is editorially significant because numerous details deviate so markedly from Mozart’s manuscript that they could only have come from their creator himself.

Just as we know little for certain about the events of those months, Mozart also seems to have composed equally little there. Just these two exquisite duos for violin and viola come from this period, and even they were apparently written as a friendly favor for Salzburg composer Michael Haydn (younger brother of the great Franz Joseph Haydn), who for reasons of acute ill health was unable to complete a commissioned composition. Henle’s Urtext edition is based on the carefully notated autograph manuscripts; the first edition appeared only in 1792, shortly after Mozart’s death, making its value as a source debatable.

This masterwork, entered into Mozart’s own catalogue of works on 27 September 1788 as a “Divertimento,” presents the Urtext editor with great challenges. The autograph manuscript has been lost since that time, and no other first-rate source texts exist. The most reliable, albeit clearly imprecise, source is the first edition, published two months after Mozart’s death. Many twentieth-century editions, however, unfortunately reprinted the musical text of Breitkopf & Härtel’s so-called “Alte Gesamtausgabe” (Old Collected Edition), which was edited by none other than the violinist Joseph Joachim on the basis of incorrect copies and is therefore completely corrupt. Even the “Neue Mozart-Ausgabe” (New Mozart Edition) is not error-free. The Henle edition essentially follows the first edition, though aided by numerous corrective interventions, described in the Critical Commentary. The edition’s Appendix presents the surviving fragment of the string trio movement in G major, K. Anh. 66 (562e). How unfortunate that Mozart never completed this equally wonderful music, which continues a little beyond the exposition and thus may quite aptly serve as a short encore. The three individual parts offer optimal flow for reading and playing thanks to the artful apportioning of notes in their layout, including, for instance, various foldout tables and individual pages left blank.

Like all of Schubert’s mature chamber music works, it captivates with its technical perfection and high intellectual demands.

Since the orchestral part is subordinate and fulfills only an accompanying function, the Polonaise lends itself brilliantly to performance as a solo piano piece, and indeed is almost always performed as such in today’s concert halls. In this spirit – and following the first editions – our Urtext edition is laid out not as a piano reduction (with two piano systems), but contains only the solo part; at those few passages where the solo piano rests, the orchestral accompaniment is reproduced in small print.",30,"Chopin\, Frédéric","Frederic Chopin, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Frederic Chopin,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Chopin\, Frédéric",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0631.jpg

Symphonies and chamber music works followed in the subsequent years. Schumann wrote his “Fairy Tale Pictures op. 113 for viola (or violin) and piano” in March 1851. An elegiac mood predominates in these four short character pieces. The four movements do not bear fairy-tale titles, but rather unpretentious tempo markings: “Not fast”, “Lively”, “Quickly” and finally “Slow, with melancholy expression”.

Only the first flute quartet, in D major (K. 285), can be dated clearly, to Mozart’s stay in Mannheim in 1777.

However, we now know that at least the e minor Sonata was written in London.

As early as 1835 No. 4 was published in a compositionally revolutionary first version entitled Harmonies poétiques et religieuses after the volume of poetry with the same title by Lamartine. In 1853 Liszt distanced himself from the important early piece, presenting it in a slightly smoother form as Pensées des morts, although it still had considerable impact.

Thus “only” three piano concertos by Haydn have come down to us. Owing to its catchy, fresh melodies, its harmonic nuances and its clear classical concerto architecture, the Concerto for piano and orchestra in D Major Hob. XVIII:11 is the most frequently played. In spite of its high profile we know neither the occasion for which it was written nor the year of its composition. The preface to our piano reduction edition deals with these questions in detail.

Another nickname is more effective, that of “Petit Chien” [Puppy] that is frequently used in France. According to George Sand, the D-flat major waltz from op. 64 was inspired by a little dog playing – which certainly lends itself delightfully and convincingly to a dynamically charged opening motif with a little dog whirling about (or around the note A flat).

For present-day editors, this brings the difficult task of evaluating the variants present in the different first editions.

simple,HN695,Oboe Concerto in C major K. 314,1,"This Henle Urtext edition in unrivalled in layout and precision. The professional journal “Rohrblatt” wrote shortly after its publication (in 2004): “An editorial stroke of genius … Every oboist who attempts this concerto must have his interpretation measured against this edition.” Such praise principally honors the editor, the famous oboist Ingo Goritzki. It was his idea to offer a supplement to the edited instrumental part that presents both sources of the work – each problematic in various ways – together with the edited part. Owing to this chosen arrangement of the score one can see all variants at a glance, and make one’s own justified performance decisions. Particularly problematic and oft-debated passages are discussed in detail by Professor Goritzki. The above-cited praise for “an editorial stroke of genius” also applies to Mozart expert and pianist Robert Levin, who has composed idiosyncratic cadenzas in the master’s style especially for Henle’s edition of Mozart’s oboe concerto; very much in the improvisatory spirit of a cadenza, one can jump from one place to another in the template thanks to a simple (numerical) cross-reference system, and thus craft one’s “own” cadenzas. Finally, a word about the much-praised piano reduction for this edition, which comes from Mozart expert and renowned continuo specialist Siegfried Petrenz. He aims for a well-sounding and not too technically-challenging keyboard part that is clearly removed from those often-found piano reductions that orient themselves around an orchestral scoring. In so doing, he also takes account of the typical instructional situation in which a professional accompanist is not always available to the oboist.",49.5,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Oboe",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,Oboe,1,1,Format,Piano Reduction paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0695.jpg

In many of these pieces, Schubert still struggles with form; the Sonata in a minor from March 1817, however, is already wonderfully accomplished. In contrast to Schubert’s two later a-minor piano sonatas, the key here does not yet result in a tragic, fatalistic sound. This is also due to the fact that he took every opportunity to brighten the key to the major, or to swerve into neighbouring, friendlier harmonic regions.",23,"Schubert\, Franz","Franz Schubert, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Schubert,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schubert\, Franz",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0697.jpg

What makes this Urtext edition particularly valuable is the fact that all the sonatas have been edited using the surviving manuscripts as well as the original print editions personally supervised by Beethoven. When laying out the text, our editor has attempted to preserve the layout of these sources as exactly as possible. Thus Beethoven’s original notation is reproduced in strict conformity with these models, vividly elucidating the musical relationships desired by the composer.

When Bartók received the commission to compose this piece from Serge Koussevitsky in May 1943, it meant not only financial support, but also an important creative impetus for the gravely ill composer. By October, the five-movement concerto, which Koussevitsky enthusiastically dubbed “the best orchestral work of the last 25 years,” was already complete. The first performances in the winter of 1944–45 were also very successful. Nevertheless, Bartók was moved to set down an alternate ending, which the composer, who passed away in September 1945, would never be destined to hear.

It is impressive how in this genre he again pursued the principle of finding a new model for each individual work. In the Sonata in A Major op. 47, which is published here separately for the first time, a new dimension is introduced to the genre right by the cadenza-like opening, by the unaccompanied violin and by the concertante-virtuoso style throughout. On the original title page Beethoven aptly remarked: “scritta in un stilo molto concertante quasi come d’un Concerto” [written in a very concertante style, as if for a concerto]. He dedicated the sonata to the Parisian violinist Rodolphe Kreutzer, for which reason it is called the “Kreutzer Sonata”. Our meticulous Urtext edition is based on the fragment of the autograph, the German original edition, the English first edition and on an important manuscript copy from the workshop of copyist W.

The little March K. 248 was presumably used to accompany the arrival and departure of the musicians on that occasion – it shares the same date of composition as the Divertimento, is in the same key, and is scored for the same instruments. Mozart later returned several times to this “First Lodron night music”, and posterity appreciated it too: the Divertimento was published just a few years after his death, and was also available in numerous 19th century copies. The only authorised sources for our Urtext edition, however, were the two autographs. Here, incidentally, the lowest part is designated “Basso”, which leaves open the question as to whether it was to be played by a cello, a double bass or both – a typical case of “as you like it” in the music of the 18th century!",32.5,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Piano Trio, Chamber",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,"Piano Trio, Chamber",1,1,Format,Study Score paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-7150.jpg

Accordingly, the principal source for our edition was a printed copy of the earlier version with myriad changes in the composer’s hand.

The third movement, marked “Largo drammatico”, is sustained by an insistent, heavily rhythmic dotted motive, while the final movement shifts from the introduction, marked “Pensierosamente, ma mantenendo strettamente il ritmo puntato”, into a brilliant finale, “Molto allegro e sarcastico”, that is suffused with elements of fugato and, like all movements, informed by dodecaphonic harmonies.

simple,HN7224,Lullaby for String Quartet,1,"In 1919-20 George Gershwin was making a name for himself with Broadway songs and a first show of his own in New York. But he was already attracted to the world of classical music – a world he would enter with a bang in 1924 with his Rhapsody in blue. He prepared himself for this by taking an intensive course in composition, during which he wrote this brief “Lullaby” for string quartet as an exercise, probably in 1919. He liked its catchy melody so much that he later used it again in his one-act “jazz opera” Blue Monday Blues. “I find the piece charming and kind”, wrote his brother Ira in 1968 when the quartet movement appeared in print for the first time. Thus the world was given a second lullaby by this American composer – one worthy to stand alongside his famous “Summertime” from Porgy and Bess.

He had been musical director in New York since autumn 1892 and spent the summer in Spillville (Iowa) where a group of Czech immigrants had settled, thus making him feel at home. The beautiful natural surroundings led him to write this unconventional string quartet in the tradition of Beethoven’s “Pastoral” – even down to the imitation of birdcalls. Since the first performances, certain rhythmic and melodic characteristics have been traced back to the influences of the folk music of Native Americans and African Americans, which led to the soon popular work being called the “American Quartet”. For the first time since 1955, the quartet is once again being published in an Urtext edition.",23,"Dvorak\, Antonin ","Antonin Dvorak, String Quartet, Chamber",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Antonin Dvorak,,1,Instrument,"String Quartet, Chamber",1,1,Format,Study Score paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Dvorak\, Antonin ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-7232.jpg

He was probably inspired by hearing Mozart’s Gran Partita shortly beforehand in Vienna. The home key of d minor here is striking, as is the often serious, even tragic atmosphere that repeatedly darkens the otherwise cheerful mood that is typical of the serenade genre. Perhaps this was a reaction to the death of two of his children just a few months earlier. Despite the work’s dramatic character – or perhaps because of it – Dvo?ák’s Serenade was taken up in many European cities soon after its first performance in Prague, and fêted as a significant contribution to the chamber music repertoire for wind instruments. The autograph sources in Prague have been consulted for this Urtext edition.

Inspired by neighbourhood violin lessons, he wrote these four little movements for two violins with viola accompaniment in the space of just a few days. This Terzetto is thus not technically difficult to play, though with its flowing melodies and spirited rhythms it still offers the best of Dvo?ák. It is not surprising that his publisher Fritz Simrock immediately snatched them up when Dvo?ák told him in 1887 that he was working on “little bagatelles”. The autograph of the score that contained many corrections nevertheless makes evident just how much hard work went into these “little bagatelles”.

What they all have in common is Mozart’s inclusion of clarinets in the orchestra for the first time. In this he succeeded to particularly impressive effect with the lyrical passages in the slow sections of the E-flat-major concerto, which was well received by the audience at the first performance. Indeed, his father, Leopold, reports in a letter that Mozart “had to repeat” the Andante immediately. G.

Strauss answered in the negative, but soon got to work anyway. In October 1945, he had completed the score in Swiss exile; the premiere took place in Zurich in 1946. Not until 1948 did the first edition appear in London, presumably for the most part without the composer’s involvement, for both the printed score and the orchestral parts exhibit numerous errors. Some of these have been known for a while, though others have only now been discovered by Hansjörg Schellenberger through his exact reconciliation of the autograph full score with the autograph particella.

He had only just completed his “Moonlight Sonata” op. 27 No. 2, when he began writing down the first sketches for his Sonata op. 28. Elements of pastoral music, such as the dance-like triple metre as well as pedal notes and fifths in the bass which seem to imitate bagpipes, are reminiscent of the later 6th Symphony.

Peter Damm, former principal horn for the Staatskapelle Dresden and world-class soloist, has not only performed the concerto publicly over 170 times himself, but has also presented pivotal research findings and publications on its genesis.

However, the elector replied that he was already familiar with parts of the Parthia op. 103 that had been sent as evidence of the composer’s progress. Beethoven had apparently only reworked an earlier composition.

It was not until after Strauss’ death that the concerto appeared in print in London, making a critical new edition on the basis of the autograph sources and performance material more than overdue.

The serenade was not premiered in its Bavarian homeland as might have been expected, but rather in Dresden, in 1882, under the direction of the then much-esteemed conductor Franz Wüllner, who had also given the inaugural performances of Richard Wagner’s Rheingold and Die Walküre and later premiered Strauss’ tone poems Till Eulenspiegel and Don Quixote.

In this amusing and mischievous piece, Mozart does not chiefly parody musicians who play wrong notes (the later title “Village Musicians” was not his). Rather, in this chamber music joke he aims an angry side-swipe at dilettante composer-colleagues of his time, whose lack of imagination and artless compositional technique are here mercilessly demonstrated.

But the fragmentary work that later came into the hands of Johannes Brahms from Schubert’s estate, delighted its new owner so much after its premiere in 1867 that Brahms had the first movement published three years later as Schubert’s “Posthumous Work” – thus paving the way into audiences’ hearts for this little gem. Schubert’s autograph manuscript features such numerous divergences in dynamics and articulation that editor Egon Voss suspects it to be one of Schubert’s experiments with variations. This is why in his Urtext edition he proceeds with extreme restraint in issuing additions and changes with respect to parallel passages ¬– thus making Schubert’s diversity of ideas comprehensible for performing musicians.

There is no trace of the influence of Indian or African-American music in this, his final chamber work; rather, the piece is striking for the amount of cantabile themes and motives, and their contrasting and artistic treatment. It seems that his relief at seeing his children and family again directly influenced the work.

In preparation for this work Schumann had studied string quartets by the Viennese Classical composers. This is why all of the parts in the quartet are treated equally, forming a splendid ensemble. Our edition has an extensive critical commentary on account of the difficult source situation. The fold-out page in the cello part was designed with music practice in mind.

Gradually, it evolved into a character piece with violin solo, or, to quote the composer, ""a piece in very free form with many passages where the violin plays alone.""

It is “little” in dimensions when compared to the two other sonatas in the same key of D major (K. 284, and especially K. 576). It is very seldom heard in concert; and in piano lessons, too, is played less frequently. Admittedly it is not enveloped by the tragic gloom of the Sonata in A minor K. 310, nor does it have a wonderfully heartfelt slow movement like the Sonata in C major K. 309, these being the two works with which it was printed in Paris in 1778. K. 311, however, is pianistically “worthwhile” in many regards: in the opening movement one can practice several standard technical challenges (hand-crossings, effervescent runs, parallel sixths, tremolos at large intervals, etc.). The slow movement (“Andante con espressione”) hones expressiveness, something that does not always come naturally to many keyboardists (a compositional trick also makes a surprise appearance at bar 25). With its lively 6/8 meter, the finale in turn recalls not only the veritable “Hunt Sonata” K. 576 but could almost have come from the solo part of a Mozartean piano concerto.

Thus Smetana described these two duets in which he memorialised his Bohemian homeland. It is a fact, though scarcely believable, that Smetana had by this time already been deaf for two years. The pieces were popular from the outset: Smetana was able to demand a high price for them, and even to play off several aspiring publishers against each other.

Although the “Slavonic Dances” also became popular in orchestral arrangement, they were originally written for piano four-hands. Yet the musical text Dvorák released for publication was anything but ideal. Now, to honor the centennial of his death, we are presenting his original version with a detailed commentary on the work’s sources and editorial problems.

Reger had already proven his adoration of Bach with his magnificent homage to the composer, written and published in 1900 and probably the best-known of his works for organ. It is an established work in the concert repertoire of well-known virtuosi, but is also increasingly being performed by ambitious church musicians.

In addition the collection offers a series of separate organ pieces – preludes, fugues, and so on – along with chorale preludes. Some rarities are to be discovered among these works, in particular a Fugue in c minor that for a long time remained unknown: this short and easy-to-play work was recently discovered in an old anthology which is out of print.

He used Nikolaus Lenau’s “Faust”, a comprehensive poem in 24 scenes, as the model for his orchestral work in two parts “Episodes from Lenau’s Faust”. The second part, “Dance in the Village Inn”, was originally written for piano solo. He gave this wild piece which builds up to an almost delirious climax the title “Mephisto Waltz”. The piano composition soon spread around the world in its own right and even today is considered to be the quintessential bravura piece.

At the centre are the age-old theme “Folies d’Espagne” and a much loved folkdance melody from Aragon (“Jota”); both of which Liszt worked into a dazzling virtuosic series of variations.

Like almost all his works for the clarinet, this Quintet was probably intended originally for the basset clarinet.

He wrote them during his first years in Vienna and, along with his op. 1 piano trios, they helped to establish his reputation as one of the most significant composers of his time. These three sonatas – all of them small masterpieces – are arranged in ascending order of difficulty and virtuosity. At the heart of this A-major Sonata is the well-known, profound Largo appassionato movement, whose staccato bass line is reminiscent of double bass pizzicati. It stands in stark contrast to the nimble Rondo-Finale, whose theme returns each time with ever more elaborate arabesques. Murray Perahia’s fingerings have been tried and tested over several decades of performing these works, and offer a new approach to these milestones of the piano repertoire.

The instrumentation for his serenades op. 77a and 141a is rather distinctive: he omits the lower registers, opting for the bright tones of the flute, violin and viola to outline joyful musical figures and catchy melodies.

He also explored the possibility of pairing off the two instruments, thus creating music of pure, timeless beauty bound with dramatic power, elegance and emotional depth.

Contrary to the earlier violin sonatas, which were issued in cyclical groups of four or six pieces, Mozart had all the sonatas in this volume printed as single works, perhaps a sign of the significance he assigned to them – especially to the first three. These three grandiose works all bear traits of Mozart’s mature mastery. The Sonata K. 547, in turn, was designated by Mozart himself in his personal work catalogue as “little klavier sonata for beginners with a violin.” – For the sake of completion and because of its popularity, the arrangement of the B flat major piano sonata K. 570 is reproduced in the Appendix, although it is in all likelihood a spurious work not written by Mozart.

Although it was officially composed for The-rese Hickel, in actual fact Mozart mainly wanted to impress Emperor Joseph II, whose chief of the royal chamber music often went to Therese’s house – “That’s the reason why I also put a little effort into it”.

The ensemble with two oboes, two clarinets, two horns and two bassoons had to play on all manner of occasions.

simple,HN812,String Quintet in C major op. post. 163 D 956,1,"No music lover can remain untouched by the emotional quality of this work, composed in Schubert’s last year. The monumental weight of the outer movements, the intimate lyricism of the “Adagio”, as well as the unusual timbre ensure the uniqueness of this quintet. An additional cello, which takes on an essential melodic role, joins the classical string quartet. The editor of our new Urtext edition, Egon Voss, not only does justice to the difficult source situation; with new and convincing solutions for difficult page turns, he also takes into account the demands of musical practice.?",67,"Schubert\, Franz","Franz Schubert, String Quintet, Chamber",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Schubert,,1,Instrument,"String Quintet, Chamber",1,1,Format,Set of Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schubert\, Franz",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0812.jpg
simple,HN813,Vallée d'Obermann,1,"“Obermann”, the epistolary novel by the French Romantic Senancour, inspired Liszt to write the first volume in his collection “Années de Pèlerinage” (HN 173). A wanderer is searching for his ideals in the solitude of the Swiss mountains. The composer was able to identify with these ideas to such a great degree that he prefaced the eighth piece (“Le Mal de Pays”) with an extract from the novel’s 38th letter. It is this text which also accompanies our edition of the sixth piece “Vallée d’Obermann”. To aid comprehension we have also included translations of the French orginal into German and English.

Which musician is not familiar with the fateful passage in the fourth movement, in which Smetana symbolizes the beginning of his illness with a violin note in an extremely high position? The previous movements tell of happier times in his life; an extensive extract from a letter about this is cited in the preface to our edition. Smetana, who at the time received a ridiculously small fee from his publisher, could not foresee that this work would later be considered one of the most famous string quartets of all time.",51,"Smetana\, Bedrich ","Bedrich Smetana, String Quartet, Chamber",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Bedrich Smetana,,1,Instrument,"String Quartet, Chamber",1,1,Format,Set of Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Smetana\, Bedrich ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0814.jpg
simple,HN815,Piano Concerto in D major op.61a after the Violin Concerto op. 61,1,"Very few musicians are aware of the fact that Beethoven arranged his violin concerto also as a piano concerto. It is only recently that some pianists have discovered this truly rewarding work. Clementi, the London composer and publisher, had heard about the première of the violin concerto and probably sensed its potential. He asked Beethoven for a piano version, which was actually also published in 1808, at the same time as the original. Several important cadenzas had been especially composed for it; the one for the first movement is accompanied by the timpani – a unique and original touch! Our edition (piano reduction and study score) contains the text from the recently published volume in the Complete Edition of Beethoven’s Works.?",72.5,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van","Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Ludwig van Beethoven,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,Piano Reduction paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0815.jpg

However, the “Three Romances” for oboe also appeared on the market at that time with a solo part for violin or clarinet. Violinists are certainly very happy that G. Henle Publishers have followed this idea of an alternative scoring. The manuscript, which Robert presented to his wife Clara as a Christmas gift in 1849, has not been preserved. However, it was possible to consult autograph drafts for our Urtext edition, which helped rectify many of the incongruities of the 1851 first edition.",28,"Schumann\, Robert","Robert Schumann, Violin",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Robert Schumann,,1,Instrument,Violin,1,1,Format,Score and Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schumann\, Robert",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0816.jpg

simple,HN818,Violin Concerto in D major op. 77,1,"Brahms’ only violin concerto was given a very warm reception by his contemporaries and has been an important piece in the violin repertoire ever since. It bears witness to Brahms’ fruitful collaboration with Joseph Joachim, who contributed a cadenza. The composer’s original and extremely demanding piano reduction has been carefully simplified for our edition by Johannes Umbreit. This Urtext edition follows the musical text of the new Brahms Complete Edition.

It is tempting to enlarge upon this statement: Whoever is trying to get to grips with New Music will not be able to avoid Berg’s opus 1. It is one of the most frequently played sonatas amongst the Second Viennese School piano compositions. With this publication Henle is introducing Urtext editions to classical modernism.

simple,HN82,Album Leaves op. 124,1,"The high opus number suggests that it is a late work, yet in reality the work comprises twenty single movements which were composed 10 to 15 years before publication. This means that they were written around the time of Schumann’s early masterpieces such as “Carnaval” op. 8 or the “Romances” op. 28 in the 1830s; but they remained unpublished. Following the tremendous success of the “Album for the Youth” op. 68 in 1848, Schumann’s piano music was once again in high demand. The composer therefore published a second selection of works, enabling him to supplement his earnings. Thanks to this, we have a charming collection of easy-to-play pieces, of which the “Little Lullaby” (no. 6) has become the most famous.?",23,"Schumann\, Robert","Robert Schumann, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Robert Schumann,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schumann\, Robert",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0082.jpg

He had only just finished making the first sketches when Manon Gropius – the daughter of Walter Gropius and Alma Mahler, with whom Berg was friends – died of polio. He dedicated the concerto “To the memory of an angel” in her memory. Then Alban Berg died in 1935, so he no longer lived to see it printed or performed. Our edition – violin part and piano reduction – follow the score edited by Michael Kube, which is being published simultaneously by Breitkopf & Härtel together with the orchestral parts and pocket score.

simple,HN822,Dumky · Piano Trio op. 90,1,"According to Dvo?ák “good music must also sound good on the piano”. This is why, on his publisher’s request, he not only wrote the original version of his Dumky-Trio but was also willing to write one for piano four hands. The piano version was supposed to reproduce the musical substance and to make the most of the possibilities afforded by the sound of these two instruments. Dvo?ák declared that this was a “difficult matter, which only I am able to accomplish”. He did indeed succeed admirably. The piano version of the original trio became a work in its own right and takes into account the specific nature of the piano’s sound through its accompanying figures, dynamics and articulation. Aside from this, it is also playable – thus a joy for all piano duos!

simple,HN823,La Vega,1,"“La Vega” depicts the view over the plain of Granada, as seen from the Arabian palace, the Alhambra. The attractive landscape inspired Albéniz to compose this delicate, impressionistic work with an almost meditative character. Claude Debussy was so impressed that he would have liked to have visited the place immediately. “La Vega” has survived in two very different versions, both of which we have reproduced in their complete form in our Urtext edition.

simple,HN825,Piano Concerto in C major K. 503,1,"Mozart wrote all of his piano concertos for himself “or for a small circle of amateurs and connoisseurs”, which resulted in the fact that – excepting a few – they were not published during his lifetime. Even K. 503, his longest piano concerto, was only published posthumously by Constanze at her own expense. Mozart’s particular fondness for this work can be seen from a sketch leaf for the first movement, on which he thoroughly honed the composition. The piano reduction for our edition was prepared by the world-famous pianist András Schiff, to whom we also owe the reductions for the concertos K. 453, 467 and 488.

simple,HN826,Horn Quintet in E flat major K. 407 (386c),1,"We not only owe three of Mozart’s horn concertos to his friendship with Ignaz Leutgeb; the solo part of this unusual chamber music work was also written especially for him. Instead of having two violins, the accompanying string quartet has two violas, which complement the dark and warm timbre of the horn and lend the work a unique tonal effect. Echoes of motives from the “Abduction from the Seraglio” allow us to suppose that it was composed around the same time as the Singspiel. As the autograph is missing, this edition is based on the first edition. In addition the critical apparatus provides a careful evaluation of the secondary sources, affording important insights into Mozart’s intentions.?",46,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Chamber ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,,1,Instrument,Chamber,1,1,Format,Set of Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Mozart\, Wolfgang Amadeus",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0826.jpg
simple,HN827,Sonata in Bb major K. 292 (196c),1,"Did Mozart intend this work to be a duo for two bass instruments, or – as the simple basso-like manner of the second part suggests – a sonata for bassoon and keyboard instrument? We will probably never know the answer because the autograph has gone missing. Our edition allows different instrumentation; it not only contains scores for the duo version but also one so it can be performed as a solo bassoon sonata, following the style of the time with a figured bass realization.

simple,HN829,Concert Piece in f minor op. 79 for Piano and Orchestra,1,"There were two reasons behind Weber’s hesitation to perform his opus 79, known as “Concert Piece” in public. As he wrote to the music journalist Friedrich Rochlitz, experience had shown that concertos in minor keys were not as well-received by the public. Furthermore he was worried that he would be misjudged as a “musical charlatan” because while composing it he had had visions of a dramatic love story at the time of the crusades, which had influenced the character of the work. His concerns were superfluous; the effective virtuoso piece conquered the concert stages all over the world. It is now available for the fi rst time as an Urtext edition.

simple,HN830,Mallorca op. 202,1,"As with his famous “Asturias”, Albéniz’ transcription of “Mallorca” for guitar became a great deal more popular than the original version for piano. He probably composed this tender, dreamy “barcarolle” during his second trip to Mallorca in May 1890. In so doing, he remained faithful to his penchant for portraying regions of his native land in music. Enrique Granados, who admired Albéniz as a friend and patron, is said to have sat down at the piano when the composer was on his deathbed and greatly moved him with a rendering of “Mallorca”. Today’s pianists can play this sophisticated work in an edition with superb engraving which also displays Henle’s customary faithfulness to the musical text.?",20,"Albeniz\, Isaac","Isaac Albeniz, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Isaac Albeniz,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Albeniz\, Isaac",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0830.jpg

They are quite likely the earliest surviving works for double bass solo. These charming pieces have until now not been published in their entirety. Despite their virtuosic impression, the technical hurdles can be comfortably mastered; the pieces are therefore not only suited for the concert hall but are also perfect encores.

At the same time he was paving his way to a wider audience, as the “Rosamunde” Quartet was the first and only string quartet that was not only publicly performed in Schubert’s lifetime but also published in parts. It is fortunate for us that this was the case because the autograph of this much-loved quartet is missing today and the only source for the work is the first edition. And this is precisely where the challenge lies, as the parts exhibit some inaccuracies regarding the articulation and dynamics. They have had to be carefully resolved, something which our new Urtext edition has done in an exemplary fashion. Its name can be traced back to Schubert’s incidental music to the play Rosamunde, which can be heard at the beginning of the Andante.

Robert did not, however, consider them to be “good or worthy enough” of her. Even so, he later counted the Romances amongst his most successful works; in particular, the “middle one” mentioned above is probably one of his most beautiful and melodic compositions.

In joint creative sessions, Schumann composed his works for the pedal piano and his four piano fugues op. 72, which he wanted to be seen as “Character pieces but with a stricter form”, while Clara wrote her “Six Preludes and Fugues”. Even true connoisseurs of Schumann will discover new sides to this accomplished composer in these works.?",25.5,"Schumann\, Robert","Robert Schumann, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Robert Schumann,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schumann\, Robert",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0890.jpg
simple,HN891,Four Marches op. 76,1,"As he was interested in politics, Schumann took an active interest in the democratically motivated unrest in spring 1848. The following year he directly witnessed the May uprising in Dresden, after which he had to flee the country with his family. These circumstances influenced his music. As early as June , Schumann sent four out of originally five marches for piano to his publisher, requesting him to publish them immediately. “I did not know of a better way in which to give vent to my feelings – I wrote them in a true fervour.” Whereas the fifth march later became the closing piece in the “Coloured Leaves” op. 99 (HN 81), the “Four Marches op. 76” are new to our catalogue.?",30,"Schumann\, Robert","Robert Schumann, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Robert Schumann,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schumann\, Robert",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0891.jpg
simple,HN892,Piano Sonata no. 12 in A flat major op. 26,1,"Beethoven’s twelfth Piano Sonata op. 26 is unusual in every respect: It opens with variations, followed by a short, energetic Scherzo which is in turn succeeded by the impressive “Funeral March on the Death of a Hero”. The person Beethoven had in mind when he wrote this remains a mystery. Norbert Gertsch, editor-in-chief at Henle Publishers, undertook a thorough revision of our edition, together with the renowned pianist Murray Perahia. In addition, the latter also provided fingerings and shares some of his personal thoughts on this work.?",25.5,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van","Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Ludwig van Beethoven,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Beethoven\, Ludwig van",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0892.jpg
simple,HN893,Divertimento in F major Hob. XVIIa:1 – Il maestro e lo scolare,1,"Which of his pupils did Haydn have in mind when he composed his humorous “Divertimento à due per il Clavicembalo solo”? It was written at a time when works for piano four-hands were still the exception – and instead of “Primo” and “Secondo”, the oldest copies use the terms “La parte del Maestro” and “dello Scolare”. Haydn’s wit keeps surfacing; for instance, in the idea that the teacher plays first, then the pupil, and in the last bars of the variation movement the hands of the players cross over without their being any musical necessity for this. Haydn’s sole work for piano four hands is now published in a revised edition based on the volume that has just appeared in the Haydn Complete Edition (HN 5501 and 5502). It is an excellent work for educational purposes but will also provide good sightreaders with a great deal of pleasure.?",39.5,"Haydn\, Franz Joseph ","Franz Joseph Haydn, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Joseph Haydn,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Haydn\, Franz Joseph ",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0893.jpg

Our revised edition incorporates the findings contained in the critical report of the Beethoven Complete Edition which was compiled at the same time. The Urtext edition has been re-engraved, but the proven page layout of the previous edition has been preserved.

In spite of its considerable length and its musical depth the work was apparently not published during the composer’s lifetime. The dedication, “Pour Mad:selle Charlotte de W…” (the rest is indecipherable) is an enigma.

Using our carefully revised two-volume edition of the complete sonatas, the performer can observe with fascination how Beethoven refashions, and varies, the principles of sonata form in each work. What makes this Urtext edition particularly valuable is the fact that all the sonatas have been edited using the surviving manuscripts as well as the original print editions personally supervised by Beethoven. When laying out the text, our editor has attempted to preserve the layout of these sources as exactly as possible. Thus Beethoven’s original notation is reproduced in strict conformity with these models, vividly elucidating the musical relationships desired by the composer.

This first volume contains the three Piano Trios op. 1, the very first works of all which Beethoven deemed publishable and deserving of an opus number. This was followed by the Trio op. 11 for clarinet or violin, cello and piano (“Gassenhauer”).

The nickname “Geistertrio” (Ghost Trio) of the Trio op. 70 no. 1 stems, as usual, not from Beethoven but was given to the piece no doubt because of the spooky, mysterious sound of the slow movement.

The Archduke Trio op. 97 was named after its dedicatee Archduke Rudolph and is undisputedly Beethoven’s most important composition of this kind.

Beethoven repeatedly declared later on that he had received no honorarium from the theatre’s management, but had written the music “solely out of love for the poet”.

And yet it pays off to take an impartial look at this overture, which is substantially shorter than nos. 2 and 3, since with its more lyrical than dramatic character, it casts a new light on Beethoven’s struggle to find the ideal opening to his stage work.

simple,HN9050,Symphonie in C major Hob. I:82 (L`Ours),1,"Franz Joseph Haydn’s so-called Paris Symphonies were composed in 1785 and 1786 for the masonic lodge “Société Olympique” in Paris, which ran a large orchestra and organised regular concerts. These six works are notable for their artful motivic work and playful wit. Haydn here pays tribute both to the discerning taste of the Paris audience and to the excellent abilities of the musicians in the orchestra. These symphonies rapidly became famous and popular throughout Europe, thanks to editions published variously in Paris, Vienna and London. The C-major symphony was composed in 1786. Its nickname “L’Ours” (“The bear”) derives from the bagpipe-like “drone” accompaniment in the final movement, which presumably made Haydn’s contemporaries think of a dancing bear.

The autograph gives one to believe that the work was originally intended to be the first movement of a sonata.

These are mature works that clearly distinguish themselves in their technical demands from, say, those of Mozart’s quartets; yet on the other hand, they orient themselves musically on Mozartian practice. The A major Quartet K. 464 obviously served as a model for Op. 18 no. 5. Be that as it may, Beethoven’s six Quartets op. 18 are completely autonomous works that are on a par with many of the major contributions to this genre.
In the 1980s, scribal copies – in which Beethoven had presented the quartets to his patron Prince Lobkowitz – once again became accessible. They represent a stage prior to the final version, having richer dynamics and articulation marks that make them interesting from a performance practice point of view.

Volume I of the three-volume Henle Urtext edition of Franz Schubert’s piano sonatas contains seven sonatas from the two earlier periods as well, which all became known with opus numbers.

Whereas Schubert had sold the E flat major Trio op. 100 D 929 to the Leipzig publisher Probst (it appeared just after Schubert’s death, however), the B flat major Trio op. 99 D 898 did not make it to publication during Schubert’s lifetime.The Adagio in E flat major op. post. 148 D 897, which is reproduced in the Appendix and which has become known as Notturno, was most likely originally planned as the slow movement of the B flat major Trio. With its expressiveness ascending to darkest despair, Schubert possibly considered it as unsuited for publication.

Instead he published only two complete quartets as op. 77. Later he allowed an incomplete work consisting of two middle movements to appear as op. 103, adding to the print the portentous words: “Gone is all my strength, old and weak am I.” Musically, however, these quartets are anything but weak: they represent the aged composer virtually at the zenith of his powers.

This applies above all to the first three pieces of this volume, opp. 29, 36 and 51. Whereas the first was written in 1837, the other two were composed during Chopin’s relationship with the authoress George Sand, at her country seat of Nohant: op. 36 in 1839, op. 51 three years later. The opus number of the Fantaisie Impromptu, op. 66, is misleading, since the piece had already been written in 1834 as the first of the four works. Chopin had apparently not envisioned its printing, and it was issued only after his death, thanks to the efforts of his friend Julian Fontana.

Next to 25 complete sonatas in the Appendix, Volume I also contains five single pieces (that had perhaps once been planned as sonatas), and the beginnings of seven lost sonatas.
A first group of nine sonatas, which was no doubt intended for the more proficient student, was likely written in the 1750s, when Haydn was still eking out a living as “chamber servant” to the composer Nicola Porpora, or as a freelance artist.
Several of these pieces cannot be entirely authenticated without the shadow of a doubt.
A second group, also consisting of nine works, albeit considerably easier “little” sonatas, leads us into the 1760s.
The last group of sonatas in the book comprises seven sonatas which Haydn composed between 1765 and 1772, thus already during his time of employment as Prince Esterházy’s Kapellmeister.

All of the Schumann titles published by G. Henle Publishers have undergone a careful revision by Schumann expert Ernst Herttrich who also added works previously missing from our catalogue. The complete piano works, comprising six volumes, are now available in paperbound or clothbound editions, as well as a study edition set in a slipcase.

In a very short space of time he drew up his one and only work for this genre. It deals with Christ’s suffering and prayer in the garden of Gethsemane until he is taken prisoner. Following the première, the publisher of the first edition, who disliked the “operatic” libretto by Franz Xaver Huber, had an unauthorized revision of the texts undertaken. Although Beethoven resisted and demanded that it should be changed back to the original, this new version spread throughout the world.

This forms the introduction to a sequence of three great individual works from Chopin’s middle and later creative periods: the Fantasie op. 49, the Berceuse op. 57, and the Barcarolle op. 60 – the finest Chopin, available in Henle paperback, cloth-bound, and study editions.",36,"Chopin\, Frédéric","Frederic Chopin, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Frederic Chopin,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,Study Score paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Chopin\, Frédéric",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-9318.jpg

Julius Grimm, to whom the pieces were dedicated, also said that “the Ballades are really for her”. Robert Schumann was very enthusiastic about his young colleague’s composition.

They, along with the six cello suites, are regarded as musical and technical milestones of musical literature. Bach skillfully employs the resources of the violin to produce genuine polyphony in some sections through the use of arpeggiated chords and double stops. The culmination of these achievements is the famous Chaconne from the second Partita, which achieves great musical density while presenting the violinist with previously unheard-of technical challenges.

Chopin’s health and other unfavourable circumstances had interfered with his work on the composition; he only completed it in winter 1839. (We have a facsimile of the wonderful autograph; HN 3212.) The printing process was also delayed – not least because of the composer’s considerable financial demands. Following his emigration from Warsaw and his full acceptance into Parisian musical circles, Chopin was apparently aware of the value of his music.

Was it perhaps commissioned by a nobleman who played music with such a group and needed music? Whatever the reason behind it, opus 25 is one of Beethoven’s few chamber music works that did not have a bass instrument. Despite the unusual combination of instruments, Beethoven had no difficulty in finding a publisher for his serenade; shortly afterwards he even turned to the work again and revised an arrangement for flute and piano (op. 41), which had been made by a third party.

The melodious Quintet op. 115 has been popular with musicians and audiences alike since its premiere in 1891. Even prior to printing – and presumably with a view toward further dissemination of the work – an alternate version was written with viola instead of clarinet, premiered by no less than Joseph Joachim and authorised by Brahms.

The young composer provided the musical background for these rousing concerts and exuberant performances.
The pieces are chronologically arranged in the three Henle Urtext volumes showcasing Schubert’s piano duets.

Volume I contains three very early pieces from the years 1810 to 1813; the other works stem predominantly from the greater part of the year 1818, and which include the splendid Grande Sonate in B flat major D 617. The final section is comprised of two pieces from works that are chronologically difficult to situate and to lay down an exact time of origin; one of these, Allegro Moderato und Andante, D 968, was occasionally also designated as “Sonatine” and was written most probably for instructional purposes.",103.5,"Schubert\, Franz","Franz Schubert, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Schubert,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schubert\, Franz",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0094.jpg

In all probability written during his student years at the Warsaw Conservatory and highly prized by Chopin himself, the nineteen-year-old composer presented the work to the publisher Tobias Haslinger on a visit to Vienna. But the publisher put off the still unknown composer. It was only when Chopin was at the height of his fame that Haslinger saw a possibility to do business – but this time it was Chopin who declined.

There has been frequent speculation about what type of scoring would be most appropriate for the piece, particularly since Bach wrote the individual parts in score form and left no information about instrumentation. Certainly, strict fugues can be found in any ensemble scoring; this had been normal for centuries. It is remarkable, though, how the cycle can easily be played on the harpsichord or piano – a strong argument for keyboard performance.

The piece’s sunny mood – it sounds much more cheerful than Schubert’s other chamber music – comes across like an echo of the felicitous summer months of 1819. The then twenty-two-year-old Schubert passed these in convivial company at Steyr in Upper Austria, and subsequently set to work composing. The present Urtext edition largely follows the Viennese first edition, which likely reproduces the original version of the now lost autograph.

simple,HN95,Works for Piano Four-hands Volume I,1,"No other great composer has left so many works for piano four-hands as Franz Schubert – altogether 54 (32 of these with opus number): fantasies, dances, marches, variations, rondos, sonatas etc. – Playing music together, often in a social circle, was a precious pastime of Schubert’s circle of friends. The young composer provided the musical background for these rousing concerts and exuberant performances.
The pieces are chronologically arranged in the three Henle Urtext volumes showcasing Schubert’s piano duets.

Volume I contains three very early pieces from the years 1810 to 1813; the other works stem predominantly from the greater part of the year 1818, and which include the splendid Grande Sonate in B flat major D 617. The final section is comprised of two pieces from works that are chronologically difficult to situate and to lay down an exact time of origin; one of these, Allegro Moderato und Andante, D 968, was occasionally also designated as “Sonatine” and was written most probably for instructional purposes.",155.5,"Schubert\, Franz","Franz Schubert, Piano ",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Schubert,,1,Instrument,Piano,1,1,Format,clothbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schubert\, Franz",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0095.jpg

This piano piece, composed in early 1789 in a “whimsical hour”, was intended by Haydn to meet with approval from “both connoisseurs and amateurs” – not least because it is “not too difficult”.

However, according to one critic, the listeners of the time considered it to be “unintelligible, like Chinese”. At the urging of his publisher, Beethoven then replaced it with a newly composed closing movement for the quartet. In addition he also made a version of the “Große Fuge” for piano four-hands.

Though written in 1790 while Beethoven was still in Bonn, the two Kaiser cantatas, WoO 87 and 88, nevertheless remained unperformed during the composer’s lifetime – not until a century later did Beethoven scholars rediscover them and marvel at their depth of feeling. In contrast, the cantata “The Glorious Moment”, written for a state ceremony upon the conclusion of the war in 1814, enjoyed a premiere in Vienna that was enthusiastically received by the public – and with its hymn “I Am Europe, No More a City” by all means achieves political topicality again today.

Composed in 1795 with no known occasion in mind, his Sextet op. 81b is thus all the more remarkable, standing out on account of the unusual virtuosity of the horn parts.

It can no longer be ascertained whether the composition was commissioned by Count Ferdinand Troyer, who had a musical salon in Vienna and played the clarinet.

On publication of the first trio, Schumann took the opportunity to describe the composer as the “Mozart of the 19th century”, whereby he was obviously alluding to the mixture of Classical and Romantic stylistic elements.

The art-loving patron Lobkowitz was thus able to appraise two freshly composed works, and Beethoven was able to make many an improvement before publication. The first public performance of the Triple Concerto presumably took place only four years later in February 1808 in Leipzig’s Gewandhaus. Since then, this work has belonged to the standard repertoire of every symphony orchestra.

simple,HN9625,"Divertimento in E flat major K. 563 for Violin, Viola and Violoncello and  Fragfment K. Anh. 66",1,"More than a few experts and aficionados count Mozart’s string trio in E-flat major K. 563 among his most magnificent compositions. This masterwork, entered into Mozart’s own catalogue of works on 27 September 1788 as a “Divertimento,” presents the Urtext editor with great challenges. The autograph manuscript has been lost since that time, and no other first-rate source texts exist. The most reliable, albeit clearly imprecise, source is the first edition, published two months after Mozart’s death. Many twentieth-century editions, however, unfortunately reprinted the musical text of Breitkopf & Härtel’s so-called “Alte Gesamtausgabe” (Old Collected Edition), which was edited by none other than the violinist Joseph Joachim on the basis of incorrect copies and is therefore completely corrupt. Even the “Neue Mozart-Ausgabe” (New Mozart Edition) is not error-free. The Henle edition essentially follows the first edition, though aided by numerous corrective interventions, described in the Critical Commentary. The edition’s Appendix presents the surviving fragment of the string trio movement in G major, K. Anh. 66 (562e). How unfortunate that Mozart never completed this equally wonderful music, which continues a little beyond the exposition and thus may quite aptly serve as a short encore. The three individual parts offer optimal flow for reading and playing thanks to the artful apportioning of notes in their layout, including, for instance, various foldout tables and individual pages left blank.

The song’s popularity in the second half of the 19th century was responsible for the string quartet becoming known by the title “Death and the Maiden”. Like all of Schubert’s mature chamber music works, it captivates with its technical perfection and high intellectual demands. Very prominent here is Schubert’s desire to motivically link the movements together. Oddly enough, the work was neither performed nor published during his lifetime; the incomplete autograph score and the posthumous first edition of 1831 have thus served as the sources for our edition.",28,"Schubert\, Franz","Franz Schubert, String Quartet, Chamber",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Schubert,,1,Instrument,"String Quartet, Chamber",1,1,Format,Study Score paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schubert\, Franz",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-9626.jpg

His compositions were already widely known at the time. The most popular work today is probably the canon with ensuing gigue in D major. The canon – according to the source “a 3 Violinis con Basso c.” – is built up over an ostinato bass whose two bar figure is repeated a total of 28 times. The following short gigue is also in a strict contrapuntal style. It is not known when the work was composed. As with most of his other chamber music works, Pachelbel might have composed it during his time in Thuringia between 1677 and 1695.

One may learn there, for instance, that there are some peculiarities in the transmission history of Mozart’s four flute quartets: one quartet (C major, Anh. 171 [K. 285b]) is in all likelihood falsely attributed and thus not by Mozart at all, another (G major, K. 285a) survives in only two movements, and peculiarly at that, raising at least some doubts about the established version, and a third flute quartet, though doubtless by Mozart, remains completely misdated in the Köchel catalogue (that in A major, K. 298, composed in 1786 not 1778). Only the first flute quartet, in D major (K. 285), can be dated clearly, to Mozart’s stay in Mannheim in 1777. There he had fallen hopelessly in love with Aloysia Weber, the elder sister of Constanze who years later would become his wife.

Throughout his life he had been more familiar with keyboard and stringed instruments, so the composer this time found himself in rather unfamiliar territory. Yet he instantly hit upon the infl ections and special characteristics of these instruments. To ensure that the parts refl ected the technical and tonal idiosyncrasies of each instrument, he asked advice of wind soloists of his acquaintance before publication. His Sonata op. 166 met with the highest approval of the oboist; a passage in a letter bears witness to this: “It went like clockwork”.

A sonata for oboe, one for clarinet and one for bassoon were thus composed; yet he was not to hear the premieres. As far as form and infl ection are concerned, the three wind sonatas op. 166 –168 hark back to the gallant style of the 18th century and thus approach the neoclassicism movement around 1920.

The first public performances in Berlin and, somewhat later, in Vienna, were such a great success that Joseph Joachim acknowledged the Clarinet Quintet as one of the best works that Brahms had ever written.

The humorous, technically not very demanding work hardly shows that the composer was not particularly well acquainted with the instrument. In a letter he admitted to his publisher that he had preferred to check a school to confirm the range of the bassoon at a high passage.

Barely ten years later he also made an oratorio version, which Henle has published as a study score (HN 9830). Although Haydn did not undertake the version for “Clavicembalo o Forte Piano” (harpsichord or fortepiano) himself, he received the proofs and praised the piano reduction as being “very good and conceived with particular care”.

The opera singer Anna Milder-Hauptmann, the fi rst Leonore in Beethoven’s Fidelio, had asked Schubert in letters written between 1824 and 1825 to write a grand scene for voice for her. Yet he only finally started work on it in autumn 1828. He used three different poems as the basis for his work, combining them to form an equally brilliant and atmospheric musical scene. The clarinet adds to its particular charm, sometimes joining in as a soloist, at other times following the voice like an echo - ensuring Schubert’s Shepherd a special place in the repertoire even today.?",30,"Schubert\, Franz","Franz Schubert, Vocal",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Franz Schubert,,1,Instrument,Vocal,1,1,Format,Score and Parts paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Schubert\, Franz",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0969.jpg

And even today musicians love to work with these pieces.
In the three Henle Urtext volumes featuring Schubert’s four-hand piano music, the works are arranged chronologically.

Volume II contains a total of altogether 26 pieces, 19 of which are comprised of four opera with three, four and six individual pieces: Trois marches militaires, four Ländler as well as Grandes Marches et Trios and Polonaises respectively. They date from the years 1818 to 1826. The unchallenged favorite in this book is the C major Sonata D 812 of the year 1824, also called Grand Duo.

The manuscript was, however, only completed after the inaugural concert and the first edition was published in Holland around 1859. Today, the work is mainly played in the second version of 1872, which Liszt made at the suggestion of his pupil A.W. Gottschalg. The latter persuaded the composer to somewhat simplify the technical demands, which reflected the intentions of the older Liszt.

His friendship with Anton Stadler, the clarinetist in the Royal-Imperial Court Orchestra in Vienna, prompted him to compose not only the Clarinet Concerto (K. 622) but also this “Quintet of Quintets”, which was written two years before his death. Like almost all his works for the clarinet, this Quintet was probably intended originally for the basset clarinet. However, it survives only in two posthumous prints, both of which call for a standard clarinet. These prints form the basis of our edition.

These four pieces are reminiscent of Liszt’s waltzes for piano from the 1830s, but embed typical melodic and rhythmic clichés from salon waltzes in new harmonic progressions. Up to now only the first of the “Valses oubliées” has found its way into concert repertoire.

Haydn was commissioned to write short meditative music to be played alternately with the readings. Haydn composed a work for orchestra. Due to its success, the publisher commissioned Haydn to make an arrangement for string quartet.

The editors were able to refer to the autograph, which is once again accessible.

The instrumentation for his serenades op. 77a and 141a is rather distinctive: he omits the lower registers, opting for the bright tones of the flute, violin and viola to outline joyful musical figures and catchy melodies.

Since then it has become the most significant and best-known work in its genre.

Although it was officially composed for The-rese Hickel, in actual fact Mozart mainly wanted to impress Emperor Joseph II, whose chief of the royal chamber music often went to Therese’s house – “That’s the reason why I also put a little effort into it”.

Was there an “external” cause? Once Joseph II had founded an “imperial wind ensemble” in April 1782, octet music was in great demand. The ensemble with two oboes, two clarinets, two horns and two bassoons had to play on all manner of occasions. As we can gather from one of Mozart’s letters, he therefore conjured up a “Night Musique” within a very short period of time.

Mozart was about to be married when he pulled this wind piece out of his hat. Yet the results are far removed from the detached, courtly style of the serenade: the work, one of the jewels of the wind repertoire, opens full of earnestness and profundity in the gloomy key of c minor.

And even today musicians love to work with these pieces.
In the three Henle Urtext volumes featuring Schubert’s four-hand piano music, the works are arranged chronologically.

Volume III contains nine pieces dating from the last three years of Schubert’s life, thus his mature works in this genre.

The composer explores the entire spectrum of the genre, finding in each work new solutions for the fundamental problem of how to find the right balance between motivic unity and distinctive characters for each movement. What proved pioneering was how he made the symphony a prolific vehicle for developing musical ideas, ranging from the heroic, the sublime, or the emotions of country life, culminating in the appeal to fraternity in the choral finale to the Ninth.

Clementi, the London composer and publisher, had heard about the première of the violin concerto and probably sensed its potential. He asked Beethoven for a piano version, which was actually also published in 1808, at the same time as the original.

One reviewer wrote at the time that in its themes the new symphony was “so favourable and easily comprehensible that every music lover falls for the powerful allure of its beauty”. The incisiveness of the themes is fundamentally related to the basic ostinato rhythms, which help shape each movement’s distinctive character.

At first glance it makes recourse to already outmoded forms and genres, even reviving a minuet for the third movement (in lieu of a slow movement) after an Allegretto scherzoso.

Baron van Swieten translated it so skillfully into German that the structure of the original text was preserved. This meant that Haydn was able to publish his work in two different languages in 1800 – with a view to musical life in England. And the impressive work on the creation of the world was indeed enthusiastically received there.

At the same time he was paving his way to a wider audience, as the “Rosamunde” Quartet was the first and only string quartet that was not only publicly performed in Schubert’s lifetime but also published in parts. It is fortunate for us that this was the case because the autograph of this much-loved quartet is missing today and the only source for the work is the first edition. And this is precisely where the challenge lies, as the parts exhibit some inaccuracies regarding the articulation and dynamics. They have had to be carefully resolved, something which our new Urtext edition has done in an exemplary fashion. Its name can be traced back to Schubert’s incidental music to the play Rosamunde, which can be heard at the beginning of the Andante.

simple,HN986,Symphonies no. 1 and 2,1,"In the 19th century, arrangements for piano four-hands were usually versions which people played at home if the works could not be heard in concert. In cases such as these Brahms did not, however, just make functional versions but creatively transcribed his works for the piano. As the composer he allowed himself greater freedom than arrangers for publishers did. In this form his arrangements greatly contributed to the success of his works in musical life in the 19th century. It is on account of their creativity that Brahms’ arrangements have attracted new interest in musical circles over the last few decades.

The first performances were given privately directly afterwards and the press enthusiastically reported: “The sonatas [...] are wonderful and will cause a great sensation”.

At the first private performances the audience was enthusiastic and it was Mendelssohn’s praise in particular that occasioned Schumann to dedicate the new works to him. The composer wrote to his publisher in an appropriately confident manner: “Be assured, I have spared no pains in creating something very decent, indeed I sometimes think it is my best”.

Brahms also provided a part for viola as an alternative to the clarinet. The revision of our edition of the viola version of opus 120 is based on the musical text of the New Brahms Complete Edition and in many respects contains significant improvements: we were able to consult the autograph for the first time; the newly set piano score now contains the viola part; and viola players can benefit from fingerings and bowings by Tabea Zimmermann in the solo part.",56.5,"Brahms\, Johannes","Johannes Brahms, Viola",Publisher,Henle,1,1,Composer,Johannes Brahms,,1,Instrument,Viola,1,1,Format,paperbound,1,1,,,,,Composer-Surname,"Brahms\, Johannes",,1,https://www.henle.de/cover/w585/HN-0988.jpg

It is hard to imagine that Chopin was only 15 when his Opus 1, the Rondo in c minor, was first published. Likewise, his Rondo op. 5, which incorporates the exotic sounds of Polish folk music, and the brilliant work in C major op. 73 were also written during his time in Warsaw. Without a doubt the young composer, who was the darling of the Warsaw salons, wrote these works as showpieces for himself. Here, and also with the Rondo op. 16, his mark is unmistakable.

And even today musicians love to work with these pieces.
In the three Henle Urtext volumes featuring Schubert’s four-hand piano music, the works are arranged chronologically.

Volume III contains nine pieces dating from the last three years of Schubert’s life, thus his mature works in this genre. This includes the famous Fantasie in f minor D 940 (see also the individual edition HN 180) and the equally beloved Duo in a minor D 947, which was first published posthumously with the nickname “Lebensstürme”.

It was in this form that the work was finally sent to the publisher.

In 1805 at a performance of the dance-like, lively work in Vienna, the audience praised its ""lovely melodies"" as well as the ""wealth of new and surprising ideas"".

Our edition follows the musical text in the Beethoven Complete Edition and as usual, provides the original horn part in E flat as well as a transposed part in F.
