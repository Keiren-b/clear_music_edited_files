11/1/22

Unsure what to do with Breitkopf attribute 4 values
'Soprano'
'Alto'
'Tenor'
'Bass'

Emailed Ian for answer
=====> remove all

Basso (Cello/Double Bass) is confusing. They dont seem to return any searches?
Breitkopf includes 'choral score paperback' as well as just 'choral score' Should we keep that? (BA makes no comment on paperback in relation to choral scores)
==> No, all choral scores are typically paperback anyway


Any Breitkopf code with attribute 3 including chamber and attribute 4 'Folder' has been changed to 'Parts'

Breitkopf code with attribute 3 of individual instrument and attribute 4 'Folder' is uncertain. Are they just normal solo instrumental books? Have asked Ian **??**
======> I'm still confused about this
========> Remove 'folder' and leave blank

EB6569 is labeled 'Organ Score Paperback' ... what attribute 4 should it have? Have asked Ian
======>change to as "Organ Score" (ie remove 'paperback')

removed codes with following suffixes -15, -16, -19 and -26 in Breitkopf

Breitkopf needs to have it's chamber music aligned to Barenreiter format. Have started on that today. For reference here is the list of BA options:

Chamber - Brass
Chamber - Mixed
Chamber - Mixed, Flute
Chamber - Mixed, Flute, Violin
Chamber - Mixed, Oboe, Violin
Chamber - Mixed, Oboe, Violin,
Chamber - Mixed, Oboe, Violin, Viola, Flute
Chamber - Mixed, Violin, Flute
Chamber - Mixed, Violin, Viola, Flute
Chamber - Strings
Chamber - Strings & Piano
Chamber - Strings & Piano, Piano Quartet
Chamber - Strings & Piano, Piano Quintet

Chamber - Strings, String Ensemble
Chamber - Strings, String Quartet
Chamber - Strings, String Quintet
Chamber - Strings, String Trio
Chamber - Wind
Chamber - Wind & Strings
Chamber - Wind & Strings, Chamber - Strings
Chamber - Wind, String Quartet


removed further instrumentation detail from Chamber - Strings, String Duo ie . dont include violin, viola
any chamber muisic including voice has been redesignated as just 'vocal'
Vivaldi concertos that are really just chamber works have been redesignated chamber - mixed
If a baroque 'concerto' contains parts for massed strings then it has been listed as 'orchestral' 

are concertos just listed as 'orchestral' now???

trio sonata is a MESS - decide tomorrow
====> where possible list as chamber music - (mixed) and then list solo instruments. Updated Barenreiter and Breitkopf

duos should be listed where possible as Chamber - Mixed (or whatever), instrument 1, instrument 2

3/2/22

for choral works, every item is listed as choral, with some having further designation at choral and orchestral or a capella. Don't worry about trying to align these. Everything will be found with the umbrella term 'choral'

in barenreiter the following 
BA2241
BA2242
BA2243
BA2244
BA2245
BA2246
BA2951-22
are methodical sonatas for either flute or violin. both instruments are listed in attribute 3. these are works for a solo instrument and b.c.  for works that are 2 insturments and b.c. these are technically trio sonatas and should be listed as chamber. 


this is the case for many Telemann works. have adjusted all 

4/2/22

when doing concerto look at Breitkopf PB15101 and double check how you want to list attribute 3. also EOS882
should we remove -07 codes from Breitkopf? Have asked Ian

works that are solo instrument and B.C. ahould just be listed as solo instrument in the attribute 3 category 
this is mostly for baroque works, but includes some breitkopf works where the B.C. has been 'arranged' for piano


Breitkopf 'Voices and piano (bc)' changed to vocal
Breitkopf 'Voice(s) and orchestra' changed to vocal

15/2/22
eevry entry in Barenreiter has an instrument listed but many in breitkopf do not. The job now is to list an instrument for every item

Breitkopf BES codes returning no matches in website searchesBES3074
BES3075
BES3089
BES3090
BES3091
BES3092
BES3095
BES3129

vocal/orchestral works such as 
DV1076	Das Vorbild			Hanns Eisler
are to be listed as "Orchestral, Vocal' in instrument category. Choral & Orchestral is something different
Breitkopf currently lists these as "Voice(s) and orchestra"
"Complete Works" should be called "Complete Editions" in attritbute 3. Have changed all breitkopf over
====> scrap this. most are organised into volumes by instrument so label each individually. look at Brahms complete edition for reference

questions for ian sent by email re complete editions:

    Breitkopf: I can’t find information on the instrumentation of these works…are the songs choral pieces? Are the duets piano and another instrument? 

    SON120	Complete Works Vol. 20: Polyphonic Songs with Piano or Organ
    SON121	Complete Works Vol. 21: Polyphonic Songs without accompaniment
    SON122	Complete Works Vol. 22: Duets with piano accompaniment

    Breitkopf: So much of the Reger complete edition is out of print. Should we leave it all out?
in Barenreiter Bach cantatas are listed as choral, choral and orchestral....should we also include things like Schuetz??

Schutz's works are difficult to categorise. I am listing the instruments at "Choral, Choral and Orchestra, Vocal" since they are so often a mix of solo voices with b.c. choral movements, choral mvts with insturments etc. This should cover most 

Pick up - breitkopf complete editions
