11/1/22

Unsure what to do with Breitkopf attribute 4 values
'Soprano'
'Alto'
'Tenor'
'Bass'

Emailed Ian for answer

Basso (Cello/Double Bass) is confusing. They dont seem to return any searches?
Breitkopf includes 'choral score paperback' as well as just 'choral score' Should we keep that? (BA makes no comment on paperback in relation to choral scores)
==> No, all choral scores are typically paperback anyway
