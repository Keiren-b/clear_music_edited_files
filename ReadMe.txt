 Is playing score (2 copies provided) correct?

B�renreiter Attribute 4 format completed

Next start comparing Breitkopf especially format and composer 

11/1/22

Unsure what to do with Breitkopf attribute 4 values
'Soprano'
'Alto'
'Tenor'
'Bass'

Emailed Ian for answer
=====> remove all

Basso (Cello/Double Bass) is confusing. They dont seem to return any searches?
Breitkopf includes 'choral score paperback' as well as just 'choral score' Should we keep that? (BA makes no comment on paperback in relation to choral scores)
==> No, all choral scores are typically paperback anyway


Any Breitkopf code with attribute 3 including chamber and attribute 4 'Folder' has been changed to 'Parts'

Breitkopf code with attribute 3 of individual instrument and attribute 4 'Folder' is uncertain. Are they just normal solo instrumental books? Have asked Ian **??**
======> I'm still confused about this
========> Remove 'folder' and leave blank

EB6569 is labeled 'Organ Score Paperback' ... what attribute 4 should it have? Have asked Ian
======>change to as "Organ Score" (ie remove 'paperback')

Breitkopf all 'performance score folder' attribute 4 changed to 'Performance Score'


Breitkopf all 'Performance Score Paperback' attribute 4 changed to 'Performance Score'

Breitkopf "piano reduction paperback' attribute 4 changed to 'Piano Reduction'

Breitkopf 'piano score paperback' attribute 4. What format should it have?
=======>change to 'Piano Score'

Breitkopf 'Score and Parts Folder" attribute 4 changed to 'Score & Parts'

Breitkopf 'Score and Parts" attribute 4 changed to 'Score & Parts'

Breitkopf 'Score And Parts Paperback' attribute 4 changed to 'Score & Parts'

Breitkopf 'Score With Continuo Realization Paperback' attribute 4 changed to 'Score With Continuo Realization'

Breitkopf 'Set of Parts' attribute 4 changed to 'Parts'
=======> see update below 2/2/22

Breitkopf  'Solo Piano' attribute 4 removed

Breitkopf 'Study Score Paperback' attribute 4 changed to 'Study Score'

Breitkopf 'Vocal Score Linen' attribute 4 changed to 'Vocal Score Hardback'


2/2/22

attritbue 4 'parts' should be "Set of Parts"..have changed in breitkopf and barenreiter

attribute 4 'soprano' 'alto' 'tenor' 'bass' removed

removed codes with following suffixes -15, -16, -19 and -26 in Breitkopf

Breitkopf needs to have it's chamber music aligned to Barenreiter format. Have started on that today. For reference here is the list of BA options:

Chamber - Brass
Chamber - Mixed
Chamber - Mixed, Flute
Chamber - Mixed, Flute, Violin
Chamber - Mixed, Oboe, Violin
Chamber - Mixed, Oboe, Violin,
Chamber - Mixed, Oboe, Violin, Viola, Flute
Chamber - Mixed, Violin, Flute
Chamber - Mixed, Violin, Viola, Flute
Chamber - Strings
Chamber - Strings & Piano
Chamber - Strings & Piano, Piano Quartet
Chamber - Strings & Piano, Piano Quintet
Chamber - Strings & Piano, Piano Trio
Chamber - Strings, String Duo
Chamber - Strings, String Ensemble
Chamber - Strings, String Quartet
Chamber - Strings, String Quintet
Chamber - Strings, String Trio
Chamber - Wind
Chamber - Wind & Strings
Chamber - Wind & Strings, Chamber - Strings
Chamber - Wind, String Quartet


removed further instrumentation detail from Chamber - Strings, String Duo ie . dont include violin, viola
any chamber muisic including voice has been redesignated as just 'vocal'
Vivaldi concertos that are really just chamber works have been redesignated chamber - mixed
===> This needs to change given the adoption of Orchestral, Concerto, (solo instrument) designation for concertos. If there is a clear solo instrument it is concerto. if there is not (eg MR1143 in breitkopf) then it should be chamber - mixed




trio sonata is a MESS - decide tomorrow
====> where possible list as chamber music - (mixed) and then list solo instruments. Updated Barenreiter and Breitkopf

duos should be listed where possible as Chamber - Mixed (or whatever), instrument 1, instrument 2

3/2/22

for choral works, every item is listed as choral, with some having further designation at choral and orchestral or a capella. Don't worry about trying to align these. Everything will be found with the umbrella term 'choral'

in barenreiter the following 
BA2241
BA2242
BA2243
BA2244
BA2245
BA2246
BA2951-22
are methodical sonatas for either flute or violin. both instruments are listed in attribute 3. these are works for a solo instrument and b.c.  for works that are 2 insturments and b.c. these are technically trio sonatas and should be listed as chamber. 


this is the case for many Telemann works. have adjusted all 

4/2/22

when doing concerto look at Breitkopf PB15101 and double check how you want to list attribute 3. also EOS882
should we remove -07 codes from Breitkopf? Have asked Ian

works that are solo instrument and B.C. ahould just be listed as solo instrument in the attribute 3 category 
this is mostly for baroque works, but includes some breitkopf works where the B.C. has been 'arranged' for piano


Breitkopf 'Voices and piano (bc)' changed to vocal
Breitkopf 'Voice(s) and orchestra' changed to vocal

15/2/22
every entry in Barenreiter has an instrument listed but many in breitkopf do not. The job now is to list an instrument for every item

Breitkopf BES codes returning no matches in website searchesBES3074
BES3075
BES3089
BES3090
BES3091
BES3092
BES3095
BES3129

vocal/orchestral works such as 
DV1076	Das Vorbild			Hanns Eisler
are to be listed as "Orchestral, Vocal' in instrument category. Choral & Orchestral is something different
Breitkopf currently lists these as "Voice(s) and orchestra"
"Complete Works" should be called "Complete Editions" in attritbute 3. Have changed all breitkopf over
====> scrap this. most are organised into volumes by instrument so label each individually. look at Brahms complete edition for reference

questions for ian sent by email re complete editions:

    Breitkopf: I can’t find information on the instrumentation of these works…are the songs choral pieces? Are the duets piano and another instrument? 

    SON120	Complete Works Vol. 20: Polyphonic Songs with Piano or Organ
    ===> Ian answers "choral"
    SON121	Complete Works Vol. 21: Polyphonic Songs without accompaniment
    ===> Ian answers "choral"
    SON122	Complete Works Vol. 22: Duets with piano accompaniment
    ===> Ian answers "vocal"

    Breitkopf: So much of the Reger complete edition is out of print. Should we leave it all out?
    ===> Ian answers no, it should be included
in Barenreiter Bach cantatas are listed as choral, choral and orchestral....should we also include things like Schuetz??

Schutz's works are difficult to categorise. I am listing the instruments at "Choral, Choral and Orchestra, Vocal" since they are so often a mix of solo voices with b.c. choral movements, choral mvts with insturments etc. This should cover most 

Pick up - breitkopf complete editions

22/2/22

What is SON271? ===> have asked ian. 
    ===> He Says to Omit

What is SON385 etc ===> have asked ian. 
===> various works comiled in a handwriten manucsript by Jodocus Schalreuter


Column H 'Tags' ...should that be a combo of composer and instrument? If so I need to go back and do a proper concatenation of that

7/3/22
Breitkopf Complete Editions completed


One thing to test in search function is finding "concerto like" pieces such as nights in the garden of spain. 

Piano Four Hands and Six Hands Attribute 3 just changed to 'Piano'
===>Is this right??

Now going back to fix Column H 'Tags' which should be a combo of composer and instrument. When updating, create new blank column. Fill with The Excel formula for this " =IF(O2="",S2,IF(S2="",O2,CONCATENATE(O2,", ",S2))) " then copy values into Tags column
This will have to be constantly updated as changes are made to the file 

If there are various composers it should be listed as "Various Composers" not just "various"

Should all BV codes be removed? Have asked Ian
    ==> Yes,see list below
BES codes are appearing on the Breitkopf website. Have asked Ian what we should do  
    ==>all should be removed

Now working through all breitkopf titles with no instrument listed 
==>complete

What are ChB####-## codes? Have asked Ian
==>keep only these ChB codes with no suffix, or the suffix -00

Some DLV codes are digital downloads so they are all removed


According to Ian's email of 20 May 2020 the following codes with asterixes should be removed from Breitkopf
**BDV
**BES
**BG
**BHM
**BV
ChB (no sufix)
**ChB (with suffix except for -00)
ChB (with -00 suffix ==> remove the suffix??==> NO)

currently working on blank instruments
==Complete

Concertos should be as per this email

Currently displayed in two different instrumentation formats

BA: orchestral
Bk: solo instrument

I suggest we list all in the following way

Instrumentation: Orchestral, concerto, solo instrument

(Everything separated by a comma is a searchable term. So for instance if I search �violin� with the above suggested change to the instrumentation format, it will return results for solo violin works and also violin concertos. I can then sort in the columns on the left �concertos� to show only violin concertos).

** BIG ISSUE **
on the breitkopf website they don't use suffixes to desginate different formats and it seems in our excel file they are used inconsistantly.
see https://www.breitkopf.com/work/9129/le-quattro-stagioni-the-four-seasons-op-8-2-rv-315 for reference
==> confusion has been sorted. DO NOT rely on the breitkopf website to crosscheck. Their search funtion will not work with suffix codes.
See this email response for further info: /Users/keirenbrandt-sawdy/Documents/GitHub/Clearmusic-Publisher-Databases/Edited Files 28.07.21/breitkopf_email_09_03_2022.txt

Remove the following suffix codes from Breitkopf
-53
-81
-85
-88
-91
-94

-15
-16
-19
-20
-21
-23
-26
-27

Keep the following suffixes
-01
-02
-07
-14




Have now removed codes that need to be removed from breitkopf according to the above list
At some stage I will need to review the items with suffixes 01, 02, 07 and 14 that are marked for removal. That may have been an issue searching the breitkopf website

Have now fixed up all breitkopf concertos except for concerto works that don't have "concerto" in the title. I'll have to find those individually.

15/3/22
DV4252 is out of print and is removed
Breitkopf instrumentation completed
Now fixing Barenreiter concerto
==>Complete

24/3/22
Ian has confirmed that all breitkopf MR codes and MN codes need to stay. Now working on aligning these
==> many have been designated as "book" in the instrumental category 

Barenreiter and Breitkopf appear to be complete

Now looking at existing website work and seeing what needs to be done
Ajax serach will need to be renewed 
Website will need a privacy policy and terms and conditions

16/4/22
Starting on Helne file. To do:

*Chamber Music (complete)
*Concertos (complete)

Unsure what these Attribute 3's are in the Henle catalogue
HN3000
HN3001
HN3002
HN3003
HN3004
HN3005
HN3006
==> listed as "Complete Editions"

Also emailed about these
HN311
HN309
HN310
HN312
HN313
HN5182 - is this the sinfonia concertante?

Henle needs attribute 4 values changed so it dosn't include hardback etc when not neccessary
Check attribute 3 fo pieces that are xxx or (yyy, zzz)

What are we going to do with piano four hands??

Emailed Ian about the following. They appear to be individual parts to chamber music pieces. The question is whetehr to include them or not since i'm not sure if there is a set of parts available or if they have to all be purchased separately

Henle Column 4 Attribute 4 value(s) - There are two important things I have changed. A lot of full scores are called either Score with Critical Report (Complete Edition) clothbound or Score with Critical Report (Complete Edition) paperbound. We have not included a 'comlete edition' designation in COlumn v. That has belonged in instrument category previously. These ones in Henle have been changed to Full Score Hardback or Full Score Paperback respectively 

Now starting on ABRSM

These titles seem strange? On the ABRSM website they have different SKU numbers
SKU	Name
9781860961922	Performer's Guide to Music of Baroque Period
9781860961946	Performer's Guide to Music of Romantic Period

also these?
